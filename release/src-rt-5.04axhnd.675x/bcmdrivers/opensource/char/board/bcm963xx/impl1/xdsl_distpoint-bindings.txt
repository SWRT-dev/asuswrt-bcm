brcm-bca xdsl-distpoint driver
==============================

This driver will initialize GPIOs for xdsl-distpoint as follows:
1. It will set all reset GPIOs to active.
2. It will set default states for all non-reset GPIOs.
3. It will set default states for reset GPIOs (allowing to leave state active if set to 1).

Required properties:

- compatible: must "brcm,xdsldistpoint"

- gpios: Array of GPIO phandles

- gpio-names: Array of string names matching above GPIOs
  * Names prefexed with "reset-" will be marked as device reset GPIO

- gpio-default-val: Array of default active states for above GPIOs
  0: inactive
  1: active
