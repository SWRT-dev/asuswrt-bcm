This directory contains an example sign_openssl_simple.sh that accepts 3 arguments
1 - the file to be signed
2 - the file in which to place the signature
3 - the PEM to use to sign the file

To use another signing command, just add your command to this directory and change the options file
to use that command instead od sign_openssl_simple.sh
