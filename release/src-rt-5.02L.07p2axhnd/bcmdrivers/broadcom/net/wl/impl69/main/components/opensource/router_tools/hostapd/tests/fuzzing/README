hostap.git fuzz testing
-----------------------

These tools can be used for fuzz testing of various components used
within wpa_supplicant and hostapd. Each directory contains a fuzzing
tool that focuses on one input handler. Each tool can be compiled either
to work with the libFuzzer or as a separate tool that reads the input
from a file specified on the command line, e.g., for American fuzzy lop
(afl-fuzz). Example test corpus is included in */corpus directory.

Example fuzzing with libFuzzer

cd @TOOL@
make clean
make LIBFUZZER=y
./@TOOL@ corpus

Example fuzzing with afl-fuzz

cd @TOOL@
make clean
CC=afl-gcc make
afl-fuzz -i corpus -o findings -- $PWD/@TOOL@ @@
