HISTORY of the LZMA SDK
-----------------------

  Version 4.32                2005-12-09
  --------------------------------------
    - Java version of LZMA SDK was included


  Version 4.30                2005-11-20
  --------------------------------------
    - Compression ratio was improved in -a2 mode
    - Speed optimizations for compressing in -a2 mode
    - -fb switch now supports values up to 273
    - Bug in 7z_C (7zIn.c) was fixed:
      It used Alloc/Free functions from different memory pools.
      So if program used two memory pools, it worked incorrectly.
    - 7z_C: .7z format supporting was improved
    - LZMA# SDK (C#.NET version) was included


  Version 4.27 (Updated)      2005-09-21
  --------------------------------------
   - Some GUIDs/interfaces in C++ were changed.
     IStream.h:
       ISequentialInStream::Read now works as old ReadPart
       ISequentialOutStream::Write now works as old WritePart

  
  Version 4.27                2005-08-07
  --------------------------------------
    - Bug in LzmaDecodeSize.c was fixed:
       if _LZMA_IN_CB and _LZMA_OUT_READ were defined,
       decompressing worked incorrectly.


  Version 4.26                2005-08-05
  --------------------------------------
    - Fixes in 7z_C code and LzmaTest.c:
      previous versions could work incorrectly,
      if malloc(0) returns 0


  Version 4.23                2005-06-29
  --------------------------------------
    - Small fixes in C++ code


  Version 4.22                2005-06-10
  --------------------------------------
    - Small fixes


  Version 4.21                2005-06-08
  --------------------------------------
    - Interfaces for ANSI-C LZMA Decoder (LzmaDecode.c) were changed
    - New additional version of ANSI-C LZMA Decoder with zlib-like interface:
        - LzmaStateDecode.h
        - LzmaStateDecode.c
        - LzmaStateTest.c
    - ANSI-C LZMA Decoder now can decompress files larger than 4 GB

  
  Version 4.17                2005-04-18
  --------------------------------------
    - New example for RAM->RAM compressing/decompressing: 
      LZMA + BCJ (filter for x86 code):
        - LzmaRam.h
        - LzmaRam.cpp
        - LzmaRamDecode.h
        - LzmaRamDecode.c
        - -f86 switch for lzma.exe

  
  Version 4.16                2005-03-29
  --------------------------------------
    - Bug was fixed in LzmaDecode.c (ANSI-C LZMA Decoder): 
       If _LZMA_OUT_READ was defined, and if encoded stream was corrupted,
       decoder could access memory outside of allocated range.
    - Speed optimization of ANSI-C LZMA Decoder (now it's about 20% faster).
      Old version of LZMA Decoder now is in file LzmaDecodeSize.c. 
      LzmaDecodeSize.c can provide slightly smaller code than LzmaDecode.c
    - Small speed optimization in LZMA C++ code
    - filter for SPARC's code was added
    - Simplified version of .7z ANSI-C Decoder was included


  Version 4.06                2004-09-05
  --------------------------------------
    - Bug in v4.05 was fixed:
        LZMA-Encoder didn't release output stream in some cases.


  Version 4.05                2004-08-25
  --------------------------------------
    - Source code of filters for x86, IA-64, ARM, ARM-Thumb 
      and PowerPC code was included to SDK
    - Some internal minor changes


  Version 4.04                2004-07-28
  --------------------------------------
    - More compatibility with some C++ compilers


  Version 4.03                2004-06-18
  --------------------------------------
    - "Benchmark" command was added. It measures compressing 
      and decompressing speed and shows rating values. 
      Also it checks hardware errors.


  Version 4.02                2004-06-10
  --------------------------------------
    - C++ LZMA Encoder/Decoder code now is more portable
      and it can be compiled by GCC on Linux.


  Version 4.01                2004-02-15
  --------------------------------------
    - Some detection of data corruption was enabled.
        LzmaDecode.c / RangeDecoderReadByte
        .....
        {
          rd->ExtraBytes = 1;
          return 0xFF;
        }


  Version 4.00                2004-02-13
  --------------------------------------
    - Original version of LZMA SDK
