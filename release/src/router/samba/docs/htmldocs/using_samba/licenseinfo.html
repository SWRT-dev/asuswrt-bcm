<p>
Both commercial and noncommercial redistribution of material
from this book is permitted, but the following restrictions
apply.
<ol>
<li> All copies of any version, including derivative works, must
   display a prominent notice indicating the original authors
   of the book and that it was originally developed by
   O'Reilly & Associates. Any publication as a physical
   (paper) book shall show the names of the authors and
   O'Reilly & Associates on the outer surface.

<li> Any changes made must be shared as described below.

<li> No translation can be distributed publicly in print form
   without approval from O'Reilly & Associates. Any
   translation, by O'Reilly & Associates or another party,
   falls under the same conditions as the original version.
</ol>
<p>
MODIFIED VERSIONS. Distribution of any modified version must
include a prominent notice describing the modifications that
have been made, and must provide a URL or other sufficient
information concerning how to obtain the original work.
O'Reilly & Associates and the Samba Team are not responsible
for the accuracy of any modifications not incorporated into
their originally distributed version. The names of the
original authors, O'Reilly & Associates, or the Samba team may
not be used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting
document unless permission is obtained in advance. Anyone who
distributes a version of the book with changes to text,
figures, or any other element must provide the changed version
in a standard source format to both O'Reilly and the Samba
team, and must provide them under the same terms as the
original book.
<p>
Mere aggregation of this work, or a portion of the work, with
other works or programs on the same media shall not cause this
license to apply to those other works.  The aggregate work
shall contain this license and a notice specifying the
inclusion of this material.
<p>
The copyright will stay in O'Reilly's hands, unless O'Reilly stops
printing the book.  However, the book will be maintained by
the Samba team.  Any changes made by O'Reilly will be given to
the team, and vice versa.
<p>
TRANSLATIONS. In the case of translations, O'Reilly will
choose when to update and reprint printed versions.  If
O'Reilly lets the translation go out of print for more than 6
months, the copyright and all other rights go to the Samba
team.
<p>
SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of
the license remain in force.
<p>
NO WARRANTY. This work is licensed and provided "as is"
without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including,
but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of
non-infringement.
<p>
GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS. In addition to the requirements
of this license, it is requested from and strongly recommended
of redistributors that:
<ol>
 <li> If you are distributing the work on hardcopy or CD-ROM,
    you provide email notification to the authors of your
    intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your
    manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to
    provide updated documents. This notification should
    describe modifications, if any, made to the document.

 <li> All substantive modifications (including deletions) should
    be either clearly marked in the document or else described
    in an attachment to the document.

 <li> While it is not mandatory under this license, it is
    considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy
    and CD-ROM expression of this work to its authors and the
    original software developers.

 <li> Translations should contain this license in the target
    language.
