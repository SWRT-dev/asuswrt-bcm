<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    
<strong>smbspool</strong> job user title copies options [filename]
<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    
<p>This program is part of the Samba suite.
<p>smbspool is a very small print spooling program that sends a print
file to a SMB printer. The command-line arguments are position-dependent for
compatibility with the Common UNIX Printing System, but you can use
smbspool with any printing system or from a program or script.
<p><h2>DEVICE URI</h2>
    
<p>smbspool specifies the destination using a Uniform Resource Identifier
("URI") with a method of "smb". This string can take a number of
forms:
<p><dl>
<li > smb://server/printer
<p><li > smb://workgroup/server/printer
<p><li > smb://username:password@server/printer
<p><li > smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printer
<p></dl>
<p>smbspool tries to get the URI from argv[0]. If argv[0] contains the
name of the program then it looks in the DEVICE_URI environment variable.
<p>Programs using the exec(2) functions can pass the URI in argv[0],
while shell scripts must set the DEVICE_URI environment variable prior to
running smbspool.
<p><h2>OPTIONS</h2>
    
<p>The job argument (argv[1]) contains the job ID number and is presently
not used by smbspool.
<p>The user argument (argv[2]) contains the print user's name and is
presently not used by smbspool.
<p>The title argument (argv[3]) contains the job title string and is
passed as the remote file name when sending the print job.
<p>The copies argument (argv[4]) contains the number of copies to be
printed of the named file. If no filename is provided than this argument is
not used by smbspool.
<p>The options argument (argv[5]) contains the print options in a single
string and is presently not used by smbspool.
<p>The filename argument (argv[6]) contains the name of the file to print.
If this argument is not specified then the print file is read from the
standard input.

<h2>AUTHOR</h2>
    
<p>smbspool was written by Michael Sweet at Easy Software Products.
<p>The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell samba@samba.org. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed.
