<p><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    
<p>This program is part of the <strong>Samba</strong> suite.
<p><strong>smbrun</strong> is a very small 'glue' program, which runs shell commands
for the <a href="smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd</strong></a> daemon <a href="smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd
(8)</strong></a>.
<p>It first changes to the highest effective user and group ID that it
can, then runs the command line provided using the system() call. This
program is necessary to allow some operating systems to run external
programs as non-root.

<h2>AUTHOR</h2>
    
<p>The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell <a href="mailto:samba@samba.org"><em>samba@samba.org</em></a>. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed.
<p>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/"><strong>ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/</strong></a>)
and updated for the Samba2.0 release by Jeremy Allison.
