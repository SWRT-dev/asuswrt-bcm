make_unicodemap \- Construct a unicode map file for Samba
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBmake_unicodemap\fP codepage inputfile outputfile
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This program is part of the \fBSamba\fP suite\&.
.PP 
\fBmake_unicodemap\fP compiles text unicode map files into binary unicode
map files for use with the internationalization features of Samba 2\&.0
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "codepage" 
This is the codepage or UNIX character set we are processing (a number, e\&.g\&. 850)\&.
.IP 
.IP "inputfile" 
This is the input file to process\&. This is a text unicode map file
such as the ones found in the Samba \fIsource/codepages\fP directory\&.
.IP 
.IP "outputfile" 
This is the binary output file to produce\&.

.PP 
.SH "Samba Unicode Map Files" 
.PP 
A text Samba unicode map file is a description that tells
Samba how to map characters from a specified DOS code page or UNIX character
set to 16 bit unicode\&.
.PP 
A binary Samba unicode map file is a binary representation of
the same information, including a value that specifies what codepage
or UNIX character set this file is describing\&.
.PP 
.SH "FILES" 
.PP 
\fBCP<codepage>\&.TXT\fP
.PP 
These are the input (text) unicode map files provided in the Samba
\fIsource/codepages\fP directory\&.
.PP 
A text unicode map file consists of multiple lines
containing two fields\&. These fields are : 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBcharacter\fP: which is the (hex) character mapped on this
line\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBunicode\fP: which is the (hex) 16 bit unicode character that the
character will map to\&.
.IP 
.PP 
\fBunicode_map\&.<codepage>\fP These are the output (binary) unicode map files
produced and placed in the Samba destination \fIlib/codepage\fP
directory\&.
.PP 
.SH "INSTALLATION" 
.PP 
The location of the server and its support files is a matter for
individual system administrators\&. The following are thus suggestions
only\&.
.PP 
It is recommended that the \fBmake_unicodemap\fP program be installed
under the \fI/usr/local/samba\fP hierarchy, in a directory readable by
all, writeable only by root\&. The program itself should be executable
by all\&.  The program should NOT be setuid or setgid!
.PP 
.SH "VERSION" 
.PP 
This man page is correct for version 2\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.
.PP 
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.PP 
.SH "AUTHOR" 
.PP 
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell samba@samba\&.org\&. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP 
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
\fBftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/\fP)
and updated for the Samba2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&.
samba@samba\&.org\&.
