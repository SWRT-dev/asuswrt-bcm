make_smbcodepage \- Construct a codepage file for Samba
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBmake_smbcodepage\fP [c|d] codepage inputfile outputfile
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This program is part of the \fBSamba\fP suite\&.
.PP 
\fBmake_smbcodepage\fP compiles or de-compiles codepage files for use
with the internationalization features of Samba 2\&.0
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "c|d" 
This tells \fBmake_smbcodepage\fP if it is compiling (\fBc\fP) a text
format code page file to binary, or (\fBd\fP) de-compiling a binary codepage
file to text\&.
.IP 
.IP "codepage" 
This is the codepage we are processing (a number, e\&.g\&. 850)\&.
.IP 
.IP "inputfile" 
This is the input file to process\&. In the \'\fBc\fP\' case this
will be a text codepage definition file such as the ones found in the
Samba \fIsource/codepages\fP directory\&. In the \'\fBd\fP\' case this will be the
binary format codepage definition file normally found in the
\fIlib/codepages\fP directory in the Samba install directory path\&.
.IP 
.IP "outputfile" 
This is the output file to produce\&.

.PP 
.SH "Samba Codepage Files" 
.PP 
A text Samba codepage definition file is a description that tells
Samba how to map from upper to lower case for characters greater than
ascii 127 in the specified DOS code page\&.  Note that for certain DOS
codepages (437 for example) mapping from lower to upper case may be
non-symmetrical\&. For example, in code page 437 lower case a acute maps to
a plain upper case A when going from lower to upper case, but
plain upper case A maps to plain lower case a when lower casing a
character\&.
.PP 
A binary Samba codepage definition file is a binary representation of
the same information, including a value that specifies what codepage
this file is describing\&.
.PP 
As Samba does not yet use UNICODE (current for Samba version 2\&.0) you
must specify the client code page that your DOS and Windows clients
are using if you wish to have case insensitivity done correctly for
your particular language\&. The default codepage Samba uses is 850
(Western European)\&. Text codepage definition sample files are
provided in the Samba distribution for codepages 437 (USA), 737
(Greek), 850 (Western European) 852 (MS-DOS Latin 2), 861 (Icelandic),
866 (Cyrillic), 932 (Kanji SJIS), 936 (Simplified Chinese), 949
(Hangul) and 950 (Traditional Chinese)\&. Users are encouraged to write
text codepage definition files for their own code pages and donate
them to samba@samba\&.org\&. All codepage files in the
Samba \fIsource/codepages\fP directory are compiled and installed when a
\fI\'make install\'\fP command is issued there\&.
.PP 
The client codepage used by the \fBsmbd\fP server is
configured using the \fBclient code
page\fP parameter in the
\fBsmb\&.conf\fP file\&.
.PP 
.SH "FILES" 
.PP 
\fBcodepage_def\&.<codepage>\fP
.PP 
These are the input (text) codepage files provided in the Samba
\fIsource/codepages\fP directory\&.
.PP 
A text codepage definition file consists of multiple lines
containing four fields\&. These fields are : 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBlower\fP: which is the (hex) lower case character mapped on this
line\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBupper\fP: which is the (hex) upper case character that the lower
case character will map to\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBmap upper to lower\fP which is a boolean value (put either True
or False here) which tells Samba if it is to map the given upper case
character to the given lower case character when lower casing a
filename\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBmap lower to upper\fP which is a boolean value (put either True
or False here) which tells Samba if it is to map the given lower case
character to the given upper case character when upper casing a
filename\&.
.IP 
.PP 
\fBcodepage\&.<codepage>\fP These are the output (binary) codepage files
produced and placed in the Samba destination \fIlib/codepage\fP
directory\&.
.PP 
.SH "INSTALLATION" 
.PP 
The location of the server and its support files is a matter for
individual system administrators\&. The following are thus suggestions
only\&.
.PP 
It is recommended that the \fBmake_smbcodepage\fP program be installed
under the \fI/usr/local/samba\fP hierarchy, in a directory readable by
all, writeable only by root\&. The program itself should be executable
by all\&.  The program should NOT be setuid or setgid!
.PP 
.SH "VERSION" 
.PP 
This man page is correct for version 2\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.
.PP 
.SH "SEE ALSO" 
.PP

.PP 
.SH "AUTHOR" 
.PP 
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell samba@samba\&.org\&. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP 
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
\fBftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/\fP)
and updated for the Samba2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&.
samba@samba\&.org\&.
