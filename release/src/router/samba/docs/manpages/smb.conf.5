.TH SMB.CONF 5 "23 Jun 2001" "smb.conf 2.0.10"
.PP 
.SH "NAME" 
smb\&.conf \- The configuration file for the Samba suite
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBsmb\&.conf\fP The \fBsmb\&.conf\fP file is a configuration file for the
Samba suite\&. \fBsmb\&.conf\fP contains runtime configuration information
for the Samba programs\&. The \fBsmb\&.conf\fP file is designed to be
configured and administered by the \fBswat (8)\fP
program\&. The complete description of the file format and possible
parameters held within are here for reference purposes\&.
.PP 
.SH "FILE FORMAT" 
.PP 
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with
the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the
next section begins\&. Sections contain parameters of the form 
.PP 
\f(CW\'name = value\'\fP
.PP 
The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line
represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter\&.
.PP 
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive\&.
.PP 
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant\&. Whitespace
before or after the first equals sign is discarded\&. Leading, trailing
and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is
irrelevant\&. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is
discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained
verbatim\&.
.PP 
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\';\') or a hash (\'#\') character is
ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace\&.
.PP 
Any line ending in a \f(CW\'\e\'\fP is "continued" on the next line in the
customary UNIX fashion\&.
.PP 
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a
string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no,
0/1 or true/false\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is
preserved in string values\&. Some items such as create modes are
numeric\&.
.PP 
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS" 
.PP 
Each section in the configuration file (except for the
\fB[global]\fP section) describes a shared resource (known
as a \fI"share"\fP)\&. The section name is the name of the shared resource
and the parameters within the section define the shares attributes\&.
.PP 
There are three special sections, \fB[global]\fP,
\fB[homes]\fP and \fB[printers]\fP, which are
described under \fB\'special sections\'\fP\&. The
following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions\&.
.PP 
A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus
a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of
the service\&. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable\&.
.PP 
Sections are either filespace services (used by the client as an
extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by
the client to access print services on the host running the server)\&.
.PP 
Sections may be designated \fBguest\fP services, in which
case no password is required to access them\&. A specified UNIX
\fBguest account\fP is used to define access
privileges in this case\&.
.PP 
Sections other than guest services will require a password to access
them\&. The client provides the username\&. As older clients only provide
passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to
check against the password using the \fB"user="\fP option in
the share definition\&. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98 and
Windows NT, this should not be necessary\&.
.PP 
Note that the access rights granted by the server are masked by the
access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host
system\&. The server does not grant more access than the host system
grants\&.
.PP 
The following sample section defines a file space share\&. The user has
write access to the path \f(CW/home/bar\fP\&. The share is accessed via
the share name "foo":
.PP 

.DS 
 


 	[foo]
 		path = /home/bar
 		writeable = true


.DE 
 

.PP 
The following sample section defines a printable share\&. The share
is readonly, but printable\&. That is, the only write access permitted
is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file\&. The
\fB\'guest ok\'\fP parameter means access will be permitted
as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):
.PP 

.DS 
 

 	[aprinter]
 		path = /usr/spool/public
 		writeable = false
 		printable = true
 		guest ok = true

.DE 
 

.PP 
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fBThe [global] section\fP" 
.IP 
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are
defaults for sections which do not specifically define certain
items\&. See the notes under \fB\'PARAMETERS\'\fP for more
information\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBThe [homes] section\fP" 
.IP 
If a section called \f(CW\'homes\'\fP is included in the configuration file,
services connecting clients to their home directories can be created
on the fly by the server\&.
.IP 
When the connection request is made, the existing sections are
scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, the
requested section name is treated as a user name and looked up in the
local password file\&. If the name exists and the correct password has
been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section\&.
.IP 
Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
The share name is changed from \f(CW\'homes\'\fP to the located
username
.IP 
.IP o 
If no path was given, the path is set to the user\'s home
directory\&.
.IP 
.IP 
If you decide to use a \fBpath=\fP line in your [homes]
section then you may find it useful to use the \fB%S\fP
macro\&. For example :
.IP 
\f(CWpath=/data/pchome/%S\fP
.IP 
would be useful if you have different home directories for your PCs
than for UNIX access\&.
.IP 
This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access
to their home directories with a minimum of fuss\&.
.IP 
A similar process occurs if the requested section name is \f(CW"homes"\fP,
except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting
user\&. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different
users share a client PC\&.
.IP 
The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service
section can specify, though some make more sense than others\&. The
following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:
.IP 

.DS 
 

 	[homes]
 		writeable = yes

.DE 
 

.IP 
An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes]
section, all home directories will be visible to all clients
\fBwithout a password\fP\&. In the very unlikely event that this is
actually desirable, it would be wise to also specify \fBread only
access\fP\&.
.IP 
Note that the \fBbrowseable\fP flag for auto home
directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the
[homes] browseable flag\&. This is useful as it means setting
browseable=no in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but
make any auto home directories visible\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBThe [printers] section\fP" 
.IP 
This section works like \fB[homes]\fP, but for printers\&.
.IP 
If a \fB[printers]\fP section occurs in the configuration file, users are
able to connect to any printer specified in the local host\'s printcap
file\&.
.IP 
When a connection request is made, the existing sections are
scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, but a
\fB[homes]\fP section exists, it is used as described
above\&. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a printer
name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the
requested section name is a valid printer share name\&. If a match is
found, a new printer share is created by cloning the \fB[printers]\fP
section\&.
.IP 
A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
The share name is set to the located printer name
.IP 
.IP o 
If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the
located printer name
.IP 
.IP o 
If the share does not permit guest access and no username was
given, the username is set to the located printer name\&.
.IP 
.IP 
Note that the \fB[printers]\fP service MUST be printable - if you specify
otherwise, the server will refuse to load the configuration file\&.
.IP 
Typically the path specified would be that of a world-writeable spool
directory with the sticky bit set on it\&. A typical \fB[printers]\fP entry
would look like this:
.IP 

.DS 
 

 	[printers]
 		path = /usr/spool/public
 		guest ok = yes
 		printable = yes 

.DE 
 

.IP 
All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate
printer names as far as the server is concerned\&. If your printing
subsystem doesn\'t work like that, you will have to set up a
pseudo-printcap\&. This is a file consisting of one or more lines like
this:
.IP 

.DS 
 
        alias|alias|alias|alias\&.\&.\&.    
.DE 
 

.IP 
Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing
subsystem\&. In the \fB[global]\fP section, specify the new
file as your printcap\&.  The server will then only recognize names
found in your pseudo-printcap, which of course can contain whatever
aliases you like\&. The same technique could be used simply to limit
access to a subset of your local printers\&.
.IP 
An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry
of a printcap record\&. Records are separated by newlines, components
(if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols
("|")\&.
.IP 
NOTE: On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are
defined on the system you may be able to use \fB"printcap name =
lpstat"\fP to automatically obtain a list of
printers\&. See the \fB"printcap name"\fP option for
more details\&.
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "PARAMETERS" 
.PP 
Parameters define the specific attributes of sections\&.
.PP 
Some parameters are specific to the \fB[global]\fP section
(e\&.g\&., \fBsecurity\fP)\&.  Some parameters are usable in
all sections (e\&.g\&., \fBcreate mode\fP)\&. All others are
permissible only in normal sections\&. For the purposes of the following
descriptions the \fB[homes]\fP and
\fB[printers]\fP sections will be considered normal\&.
The letter \f(CW\'G\'\fP in parentheses indicates that a parameter is
specific to the \fB[global]\fP section\&. The letter \f(CW\'S\'\fP
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific
section\&. Note that all \f(CW\'S\'\fP parameters can also be specified in the
\fB[global]\fP section - in which case they will define
the default behavior for all services\&.
.PP 
Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order - this may not
create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there
are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the
preferred synonym\&.
.PP 
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS" 
.PP 
Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take
substitutions\&. For example the option \fB\f(CW"path =
/tmp/%u"\fP\fP would be interpreted as \f(CW"path = /tmp/john"\fP if
the user connected with the username john\&.
.PP 
These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but
there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they might
be relevant\&. These are:
.PP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%S\fP = the name of the current service, if any\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%P\fP = the root directory of the current service, if any\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%u\fP = user name of the current service, if any\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%g\fP = primary group name of \fB%u\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%U\fP = session user name (the user name that
the client wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got)\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%G\fP = primary group name of \fB%U\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%H\fP = the home directory of the user given by \fB%u\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%v\fP = the Samba version\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%h\fP = the internet hostname that Samba is running on\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%m\fP = the NetBIOS name of the client machine (very useful)\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%L\fP = the NetBIOS name of the server\&. This allows you to change your
config based on what the client calls you\&. Your server can have a "dual
personality"\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%M\fP = the internet name of the client machine\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%N\fP = the name of your NIS home directory server\&.  This is
obtained from your NIS auto\&.map entry\&.  If you have not compiled Samba
with the \fB--with-automount\fP option then this value will be the same
as \fB%L\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%p\fP = the path of the service\'s home directory, obtained from your NIS
auto\&.map entry\&. The NIS auto\&.map entry is split up as "%N:%p"\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%R\fP = the selected protocol level after protocol
negotiation\&. It can be one of CORE, COREPLUS, LANMAN1, LANMAN2 or NT1\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%d\fP = The process id of the current server process\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%a\fP = the architecture of the remote
machine\&. Only some are recognized, and those may not be 100%
reliable\&. It currently recognizes Samba, WfWg, WinNT and
Win95\&. Anything else will be known as "UNKNOWN"\&. If it gets it wrong
then sending a level 3 log to samba@samba\&.org
should allow it to be fixed\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%I\fP = The IP address of the client machine\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB%T\fP = the current date and time\&.
.IP 
.PP 
There are some quite creative things that can be done with these
substitutions and other smb\&.conf options\&.
.PP 
.SH "NAME MANGLING" 
.PP 
Samba supports \fI"name mangling"\fP so that DOS and Windows clients can
use files that don\'t conform to the 8\&.3 format\&. It can also be set to
adjust the case of 8\&.3 format filenames\&.
.PP 
There are several options that control the way mangling is performed,
and they are grouped here rather than listed separately\&. For the
defaults look at the output of the testparm program\&.
.PP 
All of these options can be set separately for each service (or
globally, of course)\&.
.PP 
The options are:
.PP 
\fB"mangle case = yes/no"\fP controls if names that have characters that
aren\'t of the "default" case are mangled\&. For example, if this is yes
then a name like \f(CW"Mail"\fP would be mangled\&. Default \fIno\fP\&.
.PP 
\fB"case sensitive = yes/no"\fP controls whether filenames are case
sensitive\&. If they aren\'t then Samba must do a filename search and
match on passed names\&. Default \fIno\fP\&.
.PP 
\fB"default case = upper/lower"\fP controls what the default case is for new
filenames\&. Default \fIlower\fP\&.
.PP 
\fB"preserve case = yes/no"\fP controls if new files are created with the
case that the client passes, or if they are forced to be the \f(CW"default"\fP
case\&. Default \fIYes\fP\&.
.PP 
.PP 
\fB"short preserve case = yes/no"\fP controls if new files which conform
to 8\&.3 syntax, that is all in upper case and of suitable length, are
created upper case, or if they are forced to be the \f(CW"default"\fP
case\&. This option can be use with \fB"preserve case =
yes"\fP to permit long filenames to retain their
case, while short names are lowered\&. Default \fIYes\fP\&.
.PP 
By default, Samba 2\&.0 has the same semantics as a Windows NT
server, in that it is case insensitive but case preserving\&.
.PP 
.SH "NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD VALIDATION" 
.PP 
There are a number of ways in which a user can connect to a
service\&. The server follows the following steps in determining if it
will allow a connection to a specified service\&. If all the steps fail
then the connection request is rejected\&. If one of the steps pass then
the following steps are not checked\&.
.PP 
If the service is marked \fB"guest only = yes"\fP then
steps 1 to 5 are skipped\&.
.PP 
.IP 
.IP 1\&. 
Step 1: If the client has passed a username/password pair and
that username/password pair is validated by the UNIX system\'s password
programs then the connection is made as that username\&. Note that this
includes the \f(CW\e\eserver\eservice%username\fP method of passing a
username\&.
.IP 
.IP 2\&. 
Step 2: If the client has previously registered a username with
the system and now supplies a correct password for that username then
the connection is allowed\&.
.IP 
.IP 3\&. 
Step 3: The client\'s netbios name and any previously used user
names are checked against the supplied password, if they match then
the connection is allowed as the corresponding user\&.
.IP 
.IP 4\&. 
Step 4: If the client has previously validated a
username/password pair with the server and the client has passed the
validation token then that username is used\&. This step is skipped if
\fB"revalidate = yes"\fP for this service\&.
.IP 
.IP 5\&. 
Step 5: If a \fB"user = "\fP field is given in the
smb\&.conf file for the service and the client has supplied a password,
and that password matches (according to the UNIX system\'s password
checking) with one of the usernames from the \fBuser=\fP
field then the connection is made as the username in the
\fB"user="\fP line\&. If one of the username in the
\fBuser=\fP list begins with a \f(CW\'@\'\fP then that name
expands to a list of names in the group of the same name\&.
.IP 
.IP 6\&. 
Step 6: If the service is a guest service then a connection is
made as the username given in the \fB"guest account
="\fP for the service, irrespective of the supplied
password\&.

.SH "EXPLANATION OF EACH PARAMETER" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fBadd user script (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is the full pathname to a script that will be run \fIAS ROOT\fP by
\fBsmbd (8)\fP under special circumstances decribed
below\&.
.IP 
Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are created for all
users accessing files on this server\&. For sites that use Windows NT
account databases as their primary user database creating these users
and keeping the user list in sync with the Windows NT PDC is an
onerous task\&. This option allows \fBsmbd\fP to create
the required UNIX users \fION DEMAND\fP when a user accesses the Samba
server\&.
.IP 
In order to use this option, \fBsmbd\fP must be set to
\fBsecurity=server\fP or
\fBsecurity=domain\fP and \fB"add user script"\fP
must be set to a full pathname for a script that will create a UNIX user
given one argument of \fB%u\fP, which expands into the UNIX user name to
create\&.
.IP 
When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, at
\fI"login"\fP(session setup in the SMB protocol) time,
\fBsmbd\fP contacts the \fBpassword
server\fP and attempts to authenticate the given user
with the given password\&. If the authentication succeeds then
\fBsmbd\fP attempts to find a UNIX user in the UNIX
password database to map the Windows user into\&. If this lookup fails,
and \fB"add user script"\fP is set then \fBsmbd\fP will
call the specified script \fIAS ROOT\fP, expanding any \fB%u\fP argument
to be the user name to create\&.
.IP 
If this script successfully creates the user then
\fBsmbd\fP will continue on as though the UNIX user
already existed\&. In this way, UNIX users are dynamically created to
match existing Windows NT accounts\&.
.IP 
See also \fBsecurity=server\fP,
\fBsecurity=domain\fP, \fBpassword
server\fP, \fBdelete user
script\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	add user script = <empty string>\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	add user script = /usr/local/samba/bin/add_user %u\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBadmin users (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of users who will be granted administrative privileges
on the share\&. This means that they will do all file operations as the
super-user (root)\&.
.IP 
You should use this option very carefully, as any user in this list
will be able to do anything they like on the share, irrespective of
file permissions\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP 
.br 
\f(CW	no admin users\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP 
.br 
\f(CW	admin users = jason\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBallow hosts (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fBhosts allow\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBallow trusted domains (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option only takes effect when the \fBsecurity\fP
option is set to \fBserver\fP or \fBdomain\fP\&.  If it is set to no,
then attempts to connect to a resource from a domain or workgroup other than
the one which smbd is running in will fail, even if that domain
is trusted by the remote server doing the authentication\&.
.IP 
This is useful if you only want your Samba server to serve resources
to users in the domain it is a member of\&. As an example, suppose that there are
two domains DOMA and DOMB\&.  DOMB is trusted by DOMA, which contains
the Samba server\&.  Under normal circumstances, a user with an account
in DOMB can then access the resources of a UNIX account with the same
account name on the Samba server even if they do not have an account
in DOMA\&.  This can make implementing a security boundary difficult\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW     allow trusted domains = Yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW     allow trusted domains = No\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBalternate permissions (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a deprecated parameter\&. It no longer has any effect in Samba2\&.0\&.
In previous versions of Samba it affected the way the DOS "read only"
attribute was mapped for a file\&. In Samba2\&.0 a file is marked "read only"
if the UNIX file does not have the \'w\' bit set for the owner of the file,
regardless if the owner of the file is the currently logged on user or not\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBannounce as (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This specifies what type of server \fBnmbd\fP will
announce itself as, to a network neighborhood browse list\&. By default
this is set to Windows NT\&. The valid options are : "NT", which is a
synonym for "NT Server", "NT Server", "NT Workstation", "Win95" or
"WfW" meaning Windows NT Server, Windows NT Workstation, Windows 95
and Windows for Workgroups respectively\&. Do not change this parameter
unless you have a specific need to stop Samba appearing as an NT server
as this may prevent Samba servers from participating as browser servers correctly\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	announce as = NT Server\fP
.IP 
\fBExample\fP
\f(CW	announce as = Win95\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBannounce version (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This specifies the major and minor version numbers that nmbd will use
when announcing itself as a server\&. The default is 4\&.2\&.  Do not change
this parameter unless you have a specific need to set a Samba server
to be a downlevel server\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	announce version = 4\&.2\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	announce version = 2\&.0\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBauto services (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of services that you want to be automatically added to
the browse lists\&. This is most useful for homes and printers services
that would otherwise not be visible\&.
.IP 
Note that if you just want all printers in your printcap file loaded
then the \fB"load printers"\fP option is easier\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	no auto services\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	auto services = fred lp colorlp\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBavailable (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter lets you \fI\'turn off\'\fP a service\&. If \f(CW\'available = no\'\fP,
then \fIALL\fP attempts to connect to the service will fail\&. Such failures
are logged\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	available = yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	available = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBbind interfaces only (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This global parameter allows the Samba admin to limit what interfaces
on a machine will serve smb requests\&. If affects file service
\fBsmbd\fP and name service \fBnmbd\fP
in slightly different ways\&.
.IP 
For name service it causes \fBnmbd\fP to bind to ports
137 and 138 on the interfaces listed in the
\fB\'interfaces\'\fP
parameter\&. \fBnmbd\fP also binds to the \'all
addresses\' interface (0\&.0\&.0\&.0) on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes
of reading broadcast messages\&. If this option is not set then
\fBnmbd\fP will service name requests on all of these
sockets\&. If \fB"bind interfaces only"\fP is set then
\fBnmbd\fP will check the source address of any
packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don\'t
match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the
\fB\'interfaces\'\fP parameter list\&. As unicast packets
are received on the other sockets it allows \fBnmbd\fP
to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive
through any interfaces not listed in the
\fB"interfaces"\fP list\&.  IP Source address spoofing
does defeat this simple check, however so it must not be used
seriously as a security feature for \fBnmbd\fP\&.
.IP 
For file service it causes \fBsmbd\fP to bind only to
the interface list given in the \fB\'interfaces\'\fP
parameter\&. This restricts the networks that \fBsmbd\fP
will serve to packets coming in those interfaces\&.  Note that you
should not use this parameter for machines that are serving PPP or
other intermittent or non-broadcast network interfaces as it will not
cope with non-permanent interfaces\&.
.IP 
If \fB"bind interfaces only"\fP is set then unless the network address
\fI127\&.0\&.0\&.1\fP is added to the \fB\'interfaces\'\fP parameter
list \fBsmbpasswd\fP and
\fBswat\fP may not work as expected due to the
reasons covered below\&.
.IP 
To change a users SMB password, the \fBsmbpasswd\fP
by default connects to the \fI"localhost" - 127\&.0\&.0\&.1\fP address as an SMB
client to issue the password change request\&. If \fB"bind interfaces only"\fP
is set then unless the network address \fI127\&.0\&.0\&.1\fP is added to the
\fB\'interfaces\'\fP parameter list then
\fBsmbpasswd\fP will fail to connect in it\'s
default mode\&. \fBsmbpasswd\fP can be forced to
use the primary IP interface of the local host by using its
\fB"-r remote machine"\fP parameter, with
\fB"remote machine"\fP set to the IP name of the primary interface
of the local host\&.
.IP 
The \fBswat\fP status page tries to connect with
\fBsmbd\fP and \fBnmbd\fP at the address 
\fI127\&.0\&.0\&.1\fP to determine if they are running\&.  Not adding \fI127\&.0\&.0\&.1\fP  will cause
\fBsmbd\fP and \fBnmbd\fP to always show
"not running" even if they really are\&.  This can prevent
\fBswat\fP from starting/stopping/restarting
\fBsmbd\fP and \fBnmbd\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	bind interfaces only = False\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	bind interfaces only = True\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBblocking locks (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter controls the behavior of \fBsmbd\fP when
given a request by a client to obtain a byte range lock on a region
of an open file, and the request has a time limit associated with it\&.
.IP 
If this parameter is set and the lock range requested cannot be
immediately satisfied, Samba 2\&.0 will internally queue the lock 
request, and periodically attempt to obtain the lock until the
timeout period expires\&.
.IP 
If this parameter is set to "False", then Samba 2\&.0 will behave
as previous versions of Samba would and will fail the lock
request immediately if the lock range cannot be obtained\&.
.IP 
This parameter can be set per share\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	blocking locks = True\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	blocking locks = False\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBbrowsable (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fBbrowseable\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBbrowse list(G)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls whether \fBsmbd\fP will serve a browse
list to a client doing a NetServerEnum call\&. Normally set to true\&. You
should never need to change this\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	browse list = Yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBbrowseable\fP" 
.IP 
This controls whether this share is seen in the list of available
shares in a net view and in the browse list\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	browseable = Yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	browseable = No\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBcase sensitive (S)\fP" 
.IP 
See the discussion in the section \fBNAME MANGLING\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBcasesignames (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"case sensitive"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBchange notify timeout (G)\fP" 
.IP 
One of the new NT SMB requests that Samba 2\&.0 supports is the
"ChangeNotify" requests\&. This SMB allows a client to tell a server to
\fI"watch"\fP a particular directory for any changes and only reply to
the SMB request when a change has occurred\&. Such constant scanning of
a directory is expensive under UNIX, hence an
\fBsmbd\fP daemon only performs such a scan on each
requested directory once every \fBchange notify timeout\fP seconds\&.
.IP 
\fBchange notify timeout\fP is specified in units of seconds\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	change notify timeout = 60\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	change notify timeout = 300\fP
.IP 
Would change the scan time to every 5 minutes\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBcharacter set (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This allows a smbd to map incoming filenames from a DOS Code page (see
the \fBclient code page\fP parameter) to several
built in UNIX character sets\&. The built in code page translations are:
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBISO8859-1\fP Western European UNIX character set\&. The parameter
\fBclient code page\fP \fIMUST\fP be set to code
page 850 if the \fBcharacter set\fP parameter is set to iso8859-1
in order for the conversion to the UNIX character set to be done
correctly\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBISO8859-2\fP Eastern European UNIX character set\&. The parameter
\fBclient code page\fP \fIMUST\fP be set to code
page 852 if the \fBcharacter set\fP parameter is set to ISO8859-2
in order for the conversion to the UNIX character set to be done
correctly\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBISO8859-5\fP Russian Cyrillic UNIX character set\&. The parameter
\fBclient code page\fP \fIMUST\fP be set to code
page 866 if the \fBcharacter set\fP parameter is set to ISO8859-5
in order for the conversion to the UNIX character set to be done
correctly\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBISO8859-7\fP Greek UNIX character set\&. The parameter
\fBclient code page\fP \fIMUST\fP be set to code
page 737 if the \fBcharacter set\fP parameter is set to ISO8859-7
in order for the conversion to the UNIX character set to be done
correctly\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBKOI8-R\fP Alternate mapping for Russian Cyrillic UNIX
character set\&. The parameter \fBclient code
page\fP \fIMUST\fP be set to code page 866 if the
\fBcharacter set\fP parameter is set to KOI8-R in order for the
conversion to the UNIX character set to be done correctly\&.
.IP 
.IP 
\fIBUG\fP\&. These MSDOS code page to UNIX character set mappings should
be dynamic, like the loading of MS DOS code pages, not static\&.
.IP 
See also \fBclient code page\fP\&.  Normally this
parameter is not set, meaning no filename translation is done\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	character set = <empty string>\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	character set = ISO8859-1\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBclient code page (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies the DOS code page that the clients accessing
Samba are using\&. To determine what code page a Windows or DOS client
is using, open a DOS command prompt and type the command "chcp"\&. This
will output the code page\&. The default for USA MS-DOS, Windows 95, and
Windows NT releases is code page 437\&. The default for western european
releases of the above operating systems is code page 850\&.
.IP 
This parameter tells \fBsmbd\fP which of the
\f(CWcodepage\&.XXX\fP files to dynamically load on startup\&. These files,
described more fully in the manual page \fBmake_smbcodepage
(1)\fP, tell \fBsmbd\fP how
to map lower to upper case characters to provide the case insensitivity
of filenames that Windows clients expect\&.
.IP 
Samba currently ships with the following code page files :
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBCode Page 437 - MS-DOS Latin US\fP
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBCode Page 737 - Windows \'95 Greek\fP
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBCode Page 850 - MS-DOS Latin 1\fP
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBCode Page 852 - MS-DOS Latin 2\fP
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBCode Page 861 - MS-DOS Icelandic\fP
.IP

\fBCode Page 949 - MS-DOS Korean Hangul\fP
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBCode Page 950 - MS-DOS Traditional Chinese\fP
.IP 
.IP 
Thus this parameter may have any of the values 437, 737, 850, 852,
861, 932, 936, 949, or 950\&.  If you don\'t find the codepage you need,
read the comments in one of the other codepage files and the
\fBmake_smbcodepage (1)\fP man page and
write one\&. Please remember to donate it back to the Samba user
community\&.
.IP 
This parameter co-operates with the \fB"valid
chars"\fP parameter in determining what characters are
valid in filenames and how capitalization is done\&. If you set both
this parameter and the \fB"valid chars"\fP parameter
the \fB"client code page"\fP parameter \fIMUST\fP be set before the
\fB"valid chars"\fP parameter in the \fBsmb\&.conf\fP
file\&. The \fB"valid chars"\fP string will then augment
the character settings in the "client code page" parameter\&.
.IP 
If not set, \fB"client code page"\fP defaults to 850\&.
.IP 
See also : \fB"valid chars"\fP

.IP 
.IP "\fBcodingsystem (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is used to determine how incoming Shift-JIS Japanese
characters are mapped from the incoming \fB"client code
page"\fP used by the client, into file names in the
UNIX filesystem\&. Only useful if \fB"client code
page"\fP is set to 932 (Japanese Shift-JIS)\&.
.IP 
The options are :
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBSJIS\fP  Shift-JIS\&. Does no conversion of the incoming filename\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBJIS8, J8BB, J8BH, J8@B, J8@J, J8@H \fP Convert from incoming
Shift-JIS to eight bit JIS code with different shift-in, shift out
codes\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBJIS7, J7BB, J7BH, J7@B, J7@J, J7@H \fP Convert from incoming

.IP 
This allows you to override the config file to use, instead of the
default (usually \fBsmb\&.conf\fP)\&. There is a chicken and egg problem
here as this option is set in the config file!
.IP 
For this reason, if the name of the config file has changed when the

When a file is created, the necessary permissions are calculated
according to the mapping from DOS modes to UNIX permissions, and the
resulting UNIX mode is then bit-wise \'AND\'ed with this parameter\&.
This parameter may be thought of as a bit-wise MASK for the UNIX modes
of a file\&. Any bit \fI*not*\fP set here will be removed from the modes set

it is disconnected\&. The deadtime only takes effect if the number of
open files is zero\&.
.IP 
This is useful to stop a server\'s resources being exhausted by a large
number of inactive connections\&.
.IP 
Most clients have an auto-reconnect feature when a connection is
broken so in most cases this parameter should be transparent to users\&.
.IP 
Using this parameter with a timeout of a few minutes is recommended

.IP 
This is the full pathname to a script that will be run \fIAS ROOT\fP by
\fBsmbd (8)\fP under special circumstances decribed
below\&.
.IP 
Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are created for all
users accessing files on this server\&. For sites that use Windows NT
account databases as their primary user database creating these users
and keeping the user list in sync with the Windows NT PDC is an
onerous task\&. This option allows \fBsmbd\fP to delete
the required UNIX users \fION DEMAND\fP when a user accesses the Samba
server and the Windows NT user no longer exists\&.
.IP 
In order to use this option, \fBsmbd\fP must be set to
\fBsecurity=domain\fP and \fB"delete user
script"\fP must be set to a full pathname for a script that will delete
a UNIX user given one argument of \fB%u\fP, which expands into the UNIX
user name to delete\&. \fINOTE\fP that this is different to the
\fBadd user script\fP which will work with the
\fBsecurity=server\fP option as well as
\fBsecurity=domain\fP\&. The reason for this
is only when Samba is a domain member does it get the information
on an attempted user logon that a user no longer exists\&. In the
\fBsecurity=server\fP mode a missing user
is treated the same as an invalid password logon attempt\&. Deleting
the user in this circumstance would not be a good idea\&.
.IP 
When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, at
\fI"login"\fP(session setup in the SMB protocol) time,
\fBsmbd\fP contacts the \fBpassword
server\fP and attempts to authenticate the given user
with the given password\&. If the authentication fails with the specific
Domain error code meaning that the user no longer exists then
\fBsmbd\fP attempts to find a UNIX user in the UNIX
password database that matches the Windows user account\&. If this lookup succeeds,
and \fB"delete user script"\fP is set then \fBsmbd\fP will
call the specified script \fIAS ROOT\fP, expanding any \fB%u\fP argument
to be the user name to delete\&.
.IP 
This script should delete the given UNIX username\&. In this way, UNIX
users are dynamically deleted to match existing Windows NT accounts\&.

.IP 
This option is used when Samba is attempting to delete a directory
that contains one or more vetoed directories (see the \fB\'veto
files\'\fP option)\&.  If this option is set to False (the
default) then if a vetoed directory contains any non-vetoed files or
directories then the directory delete will fail\&. This is usually what
you want\&.
.IP 
If this option is set to True, then Samba will attempt to recursively
delete any files and directories within the vetoed directory\&. This can
be useful for integration with file serving systems such as \fBNetAtalk\fP,
which create meta-files within directories you might normally veto
DOS/Windows users from seeing (e\&.g\&. \f(CW\&.AppleDouble\fP)

systems\&. The symptom that was seen was an error of "Abort Retry
Ignore" at the end of each directory listing\&.
.IP 
This setting allows the replacement of the internal routines to
calculate the total disk space and amount available with an external

this function\&.
.IP 
The external program will be passed a single parameter indicating a
directory in the filesystem being queried\&. This will typically consist
of the string \f(CW"\&./"\fP\&. The script should return two integers in
ascii\&. The first should be the total disk space in blocks, and the
second should be the number of available blocks\&. An optional third
return value can give the block size in bytes\&. The default blocksize

.IP 
This parameter is applied as a mask (AND\'ed with) to the changed

to \fBsmbd\fP\&.
.IP 
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++
when used against Samba shares\&. If oplocks are enabled on a share,
Visual C++ uses two different time reading calls to check if a file
has changed since it was last read\&. One of these calls uses a
one-second granularity, the other uses a two second granularity\&. As
the two second call rounds any odd second down, then if the file has a
timestamp of an odd number of seconds then the two timestamps will not
match and Visual C++ will keep reporting the file has changed\&. Setting
this option causes the two timestamps to match, and Visual C++ is
happy\&.

.IP "\fBfake directory create times (S)\fP" 
.IP 
NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files
and directories\&. This is not the same as the ctime - status change
time - that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of
the various times Unix does keep\&. Setting this parameter for a share
causes Samba to always report midnight 1-1-1980 as the create time for
directories\&.
.IP 
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++
when used against Samba shares\&. Visual C++ generated makefiles have
the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make
rule to create the directory\&. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it
uses the creation time when examining a directory\&. Thus the object
directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist
it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it
contains\&.
.IP 
However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by
Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or deleted in the
directory\&. NMAKE therefore finds all object files in the object
directory bar the last one built are out of date compared to the
directory and rebuilds them\&. Enabling this option ensures directories
always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as
expected\&.

Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission from a server to

When you set \f(CW"fake oplocks = yes"\fP \fBsmbd\fP will
always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the
file\&.
.IP 
It is generally much better to use the real \fBoplocks\fP
support rather than this parameter\&.
.IP 
If you enable this option on all read-only shares or shares that you
know will only be accessed from one client at a time such as
physically read-only media like CDROMs, you will see a big performance
improvement on many operations\&. If you enable this option on shares
where multiple clients may be accessing the files read-write at the
same time you can get data corruption\&. Use this option carefully!
.IP 
This option is disabled by default\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBfollow symlinks (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter allows the Samba administrator to stop
\fBsmbd\fP from following symbolic links in a
particular share\&. Setting this parameter to \fI"No"\fP prevents any file
or directory that is a symbolic link from being followed (the user
will get an error)\&.  This option is very useful to stop users from
adding a symbolic link to \f(CW/etc/passwd\fP in their home directory for
instance\&.  However it will slow filename lookups down slightly\&.
.IP 
This option is enabled (i\&.e\&. \fBsmbd\fP will follow
symbolic links) by default\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBforce create mode (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit permissions that will
\fI*always*\fP be set on a file by Samba\&. This is done by bitwise
\'OR\'ing these bits onto the mode bits of a file that is being created
or having its permissions changed\&. The default for this parameter is
(in octal) 000\&. The modes in this parameter are bitwise \'OR\'ed onto
the file mode after the mask set in the \fB"create
mask"\fP parameter is applied\&.
.IP 
See also the parameter \fB"create mask"\fP for details
on masking mode bits on files\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"inherit permissions"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	force create mode = 000\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	force create mode = 0755\fP
.IP 
would force all created files to have read and execute permissions set
for \'group\' and \'other\' as well as the read/write/execute bits set for
the \'user\'\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBforce directory mode (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies a set of UNIX mode bit permissions that will
\fI*always*\fP be set on a directory created by Samba\&. This is done by
bitwise \'OR\'ing these bits onto the mode bits of a directory that is
being created\&. The default for this parameter is (in octal) 0000 which
will not add any extra permission bits to a created directory\&. This
operation is done after the mode mask in the parameter
\fB"directory mask"\fP is applied\&.
.IP 
See also the parameter \fB"directory mask"\fP for
details on masking mode bits on created directories\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"inherit permissions"\fP parameter\&.

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	force directory mode = 000\fP
.IP

permissions set for \'group\' and \'other\' as well as the
read/write/execute bits set for the \'user\'\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBforce directory security mode (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits can be modified when
a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX permission on a directory
using the native NT security dialog box\&.
.IP 
This parameter is applied as a mask (OR\'ed with) to the changed
permission bits, thus forcing any bits in this mask that the user may
have modified to be on\&. Essentially, one bits in this mask may be
treated as a set of bits that, when modifying security on a directory,
the user has always set to be \'on\'\&.
.IP 
If not set explicitly this parameter is set to the same value as the
\fBforce directory mode\fP parameter\&. To allow
a user to modify all the user/group/world permissions on a directory,
with restrictions set this parameter to 000\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that users who can access the Samba server through other
means can easily bypass this restriction, so it is primarily
useful for standalone "appliance" systems\&.  Administrators of
most normal systems will probably want to set it to 0000\&.

.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	force directory security mode = 0\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBforce group (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This specifies a UNIX group name that will be assigned as the default
primary group for all users connecting to this service\&. This is useful
for sharing files by ensuring that all access to files on service will
use the named group for their permissions checking\&. Thus, by assigning
permissions for this group to the files and directories within this
service the Samba administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these
files\&.
.IP 
In Samba 2\&.0\&.5 and above this parameter has extended functionality in the following
way\&. If the group name listed here has a \'+\' character prepended to it
then the current user accessing the share only has the primary group 
default assigned to this group if they are already assigned as a member
of that group\&. This allows an administrator to decide that only users
who are already in a particular group will create files with group 
ownership set to that group\&. This gives a finer granularity of ownership
assignment\&. For example, the setting \f(CWforce group = +sys\fP means
that only users who are already in group sys will have their default
primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share\&. All
other users will retain their ordinary primary group\&.
.IP 
If the \fB"force user"\fP parameter is also set the
group specified in \fBforce group\fP will override the primary group
set in \fB"force user"\fP\&.
.IP

.IP 
.IP "\fBforce user (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This specifies a UNIX user name that will be assigned as the default
user for all users connecting to this service\&. This is useful for
sharing files\&. You should also use it carefully as using it
incorrectly can cause security problems\&.
.IP 
This user name only gets used once a connection is established\&. Thus
clients still need to connect as a valid user and supply a valid
password\&. Once connected, all file operations will be performed as the
\f(CW"forced user"\fP, no matter what username the client connected as\&.
.IP 
This can be very useful\&.
.IP 
In Samba 2\&.0\&.5 and above this parameter also causes the primary
group of the forced user to be used as the primary group for all
file activity\&. Prior to 2\&.0\&.5 the primary group was left as the
primary group of the connecting user (this was a bug)\&.

This parameter allows the administrator to configure the string that
specifies the type of filesystem a share is using that is reported by
\fBsmbd\fP when a client queries the filesystem type
for a share\&. The default type is \fB"NTFS"\fP for compatibility with
Windows NT but this can be changed to other strings such as "Samba" or

Synonym for \fB"force group"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBguest account (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a username which will be used for access to services which are
specified as \fB\'guest ok\'\fP (see below)\&. Whatever
privileges this user has will be available to any client connecting to
the guest service\&. Typically this user will exist in the password
file, but will not have a valid login\&. The user account \fB"ftp"\fP is
often a good choice for this parameter\&. If a username is specified in
a given service, the specified username overrides this one\&.
.IP 
One some systems the default guest account "nobody" may not be able to
print\&. Use another account in this case\&. You should test this by
trying to log in as your guest user (perhaps by using the \f(CW"su -"\fP
command) and trying to print using the system print command such as
\fBlpr (1)\fP or \fBlp (1)\fP\&.

.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	hide dot files = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBhide files(S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of files or directories that are not visible but are
accessible\&.  The DOS \'hidden\' attribute is applied to any files or
directories that match\&.
.IP 
Each entry in the list must be separated by a \f(CW\'/\'\fP, which allows
spaces to be included in the entry\&.  \f(CW\'*\'\fP and \f(CW\'?\'\fP can be used
to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards\&.
.IP 
Each entry must be a Unix path, not a DOS path and must not include the 
Unix directory separator \f(CW\'/\'\fP\&.
.IP 
Note that the case sensitivity option is applicable in hiding files\&.
.IP 
Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as it
will be forced to check all files and directories for a match as they
are scanned\&.

.IP "\fBhomedir map (G)\fP" 
.IP 
If \fB"nis homedir"\fP is true, and
\fBsmbd\fP is also acting as a Win95/98 \fBlogon
server\fP then this parameter specifies the NIS (or YP)
map from which the server for the user\'s home directory should be
extracted\&.  At present, only the Sun auto\&.home map format is
understood\&. The form of the map is:
.IP 
\f(CWusername	server:/some/file/system\fP

and the program will extract the servername from before the first
\f(CW\':\'\fP\&.  There should probably be a better parsing system that copes

.IP "\fBhosts allow (S)\fP" 
.IP 
A synonym for this parameter is \fB\'allow hosts\'\fP
.IP 
This parameter is a comma, space, or tab delimited set of hosts which
are permitted to access a service\&.
.IP 
If specified in the \fB[global]\fP section then it will
apply to all services, regardless of whether the individual service
has a different setting\&.
.IP 
You can specify the hosts by name or IP number\&. For example, you could
restrict access to only the hosts on a Class C subnet with something
like \f(CW"allow hosts = 150\&.203\&.5\&."\fP\&. The full syntax of the list is
described in the man page \fBhosts_access (5)\fP\&. Note that this man
page may not be present on your system, so a brief description will
be given here also\&.
.IP 
Note that the localhost address 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 will always be allowed
access unless specifically denied by a "hosts deny" option\&.
.IP 
You can also specify hosts by network/netmask pairs and by netgroup
names if your system supports netgroups\&. The \fIEXCEPT\fP keyword can also
be used to limit a wildcard list\&. The following examples may provide
some help:
.IP 
\fBExample 1\fP: allow all IPs in 150\&.203\&.*\&.* except one
.IP 
\f(CW	hosts allow = 150\&.203\&. EXCEPT 150\&.203\&.6\&.66\fP

.IP 
.IP "\fBhosts equiv (G)\fP" 
.IP 
If this global parameter is a non-null string, it specifies the name
of a file to read for the names of hosts and users who will be allowed
access without specifying a password\&.
.IP 
This is not be confused with \fBhosts allow\fP which
is about hosts access to services and is more useful for guest
services\&. \fBhosts equiv\fP may be useful for NT clients which will not
supply passwords to samba\&.
.IP 
NOTE: The use of \fBhosts equiv\fP can be a major security hole\&. This is
because you are trusting the PC to supply the correct username\&. It is
very easy to get a PC to supply a false username\&. I recommend that the
\fBhosts equiv\fP option be only used if you really know what you are
doing, or perhaps on a home network where you trust your spouse and
kids\&. And only if you \fIreally\fP trust them :-)\&.

\fB%P\fP and \fB%S\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBinherit permissions (S)\fP" 
.IP 
The permissions on new files and directories are normally governed by
\fB"create mask"\fP,
\fB"directory mask"\fP,
\fB"force create mode"\fP and
\fB"force directory mode"\fP
but the boolean inherit permissions parameter overrides this\&.
.IP 
New directories inherit the mode of the parent directory,
including bits such as setgid\&.
.IP 
New files inherit their read/write bits from the parent directory\&.
Their execute bits continue to be determined by
\fB"map archive"\fP,
\fB"map hidden"\fP and
\fB"map system"\fP as usual\&.
.IP 
Note that the setuid bit is *never* set via inheritance
(the code explicitly prohibits this)\&.
.IP 
This can be particularly useful on large systems with many users,
perhaps several thousand,
to allow a single \fB[homes]\fP share to be used flexibly by each user\&.

.IP "\fBinterfaces (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows you to override the default network interfaces list
that Samba will use for browsing, name registration and other NBT
traffic\&. By default Samba will query the kernel for the list of all
active interfaces and use any interfaces except 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 that are
broadcast capable\&.
.IP 
The option takes a list of interface strings\&. Each string can be in
any of the following forms:
.IP 
.IP o 
a network interface name (such as eth0)\&. This may include
shell-like wildcards so eth* will match any interface starting
with the substring "eth"
.IP o 
an IP address\&. In this case the netmask is determined
from the list of interfaces obtained from the kernel
.IP o 
an IP/mask pair\&. 
.IP o 
a broadcast/mask pair\&. 
.IP 
The "mask" parameters can either be a bit length (such as 24 for a C
class network) or a full netmask in dotted decmal form\&.
.IP 
The "IP" parameters above can either be a full dotted decimal IP
address or a hostname which will be looked up via the OSes normal
hostname resolution mechanisms\&.
.IP 
For example, the following line:
.IP 
\f(CWinterfaces = eth0 192\&.168\&.2\&.10/24 192\&.168\&.3\&.10/255\&.255\&.255\&.0\fP
.IP 
would configure three network interfaces corresponding to the eth0
device and IP addresses 192\&.168\&.2\&.10 and 192\&.168\&.3\&.10\&. The netmasks of
the latter two interfaces would be set to 255\&.255\&.255\&.0\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"bind interfaces only"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBinvalid users (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of users that should not be allowed to login to this
service\&. This is really a \fI"paranoid"\fP check to absolutely ensure an
improper setting does not breach your security\&.
.IP 
A name starting with a \f(CW\'@\'\fP is interpreted as an NIS netgroup first
(if your system supports NIS), and then as a UNIX group if the name
was not found in the NIS netgroup database\&.
.IP 
A name starting with \f(CW\'+\'\fP is interpreted only by looking in the
UNIX group database\&. A name starting with \f(CW\'&\'\fP is interpreted only
by looking in the NIS netgroup database (this requires NIS to be
working on your system)\&. The characters \f(CW\'+\'\fP and \f(CW\'&\'\fP may be
used at the start of the name in either order so the value
\f(CW"+&group"\fP means check the UNIX group database, followed by the NIS
netgroup database, and the value \f(CW"&+group"\fP means check the NIS
netgroup database, followed by the UNIX group database (the same as
the \f(CW\'@\'\fP prefix)\&.
.IP

.IP 
The value of the parameter (an integer) represents the number of
seconds between \fB\'keepalive\'\fP packets\&. If this parameter is zero, no
keepalive packets will be sent\&. Keepalive packets, if sent, allow the
server to tell whether a client is still present and responding\&.
.IP 
Keepalives should, in general, not be needed if the socket being used

.IP "\fBkernel oplocks (G)\fP" 
.IP 
For UNIXs that support kernel based \fBoplocks\fP
(currently only IRIX but hopefully also Linux and FreeBSD soon) this
parameter allows the use of them to be turned on or off\&.
.IP 
Kernel oplocks support allows Samba \fBoplocks\fP to be
broken whenever a local UNIX process or NFS operation accesses a file
that \fBsmbd\fP has oplocked\&. This allows complete
data consistency between SMB/CIFS, NFS and local file access (and is a
\fIvery\fP cool feature :-)\&.

are only available if your version of Samba was configured with
the \fB--with-ldap\fP option\&.

This parameter specifies the DNS name of the LDAP server to use
for SMB/CIFS authentication purposes\&.

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	ldap server = localhost\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBldap suffix (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is part of the \fIEXPERIMENTAL\fP Samba support for a

are only available if your version of Samba was configured with
the \fB--with-ldap\fP option\&.
.IP 
This parameter specifies the \f(CW"dn"\fP or LDAP \fI"distinguished name"\fP

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	empty string\&.\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlevel2 oplocks (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter (new in Samba 2\&.0\&.5) controls whether Samba supports
level2 (read-only) oplocks on a share\&. In Samba 2\&.0\&.5 this parameter
defaults to "False" as the code is new, but will default to "True"
in a later release\&.
.IP 
Level2, or read-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients that have an
oplock on a file to downgrade from a read-write oplock to a read-only
oplock once a second client opens the file (instead of releasing all
oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, exclusive oplocks)\&. This
allows all openers of the file that support level2 oplocks to cache
the file for read-ahead only (ie\&. they may not cache writes or lock
requests) and increases performance for many acesses of files that
are not commonly written (such as application \&.EXE files)\&.
.IP 
Once one of the clients which have a read-only oplock writes to
the file all clients are notified (no reply is needed or waited
for) and told to break their oplocks to "none" and delete any
read-ahead caches\&.
.IP 
It is recommended that this parameter be turned on to speed access
to shared executables (and also to test the code :-)\&.
.IP 
For more discussions on level2 oplocks see the CIFS spec\&.
.IP 
Currently, if \fB"kernel oplocks"\fP are supported
then level2 oplocks are not granted (even if this parameter is set
to \f(CW"true"\fP)\&. Note also, the \fB"oplocks"\fP parameter must
be set to "true" on this share in order for this parameter to have any
effect\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"oplocks"\fP and \fB"kernel oplocks"\fP parameters\&.

.IP "\fBlm announce (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter determines if \fBnmbd\fP will produce
Lanman announce broadcasts that are needed by \fBOS/2\fP clients in order
for them to see the Samba server in their browse list\&. This parameter
can have three values, \f(CW"true"\fP, \f(CW"false"\fP, or \f(CW"auto"\fP\&. The
default is \f(CW"auto"\fP\&.  If set to \f(CW"false"\fP Samba will never produce
these broadcasts\&. If set to \f(CW"true"\fP Samba will produce Lanman
announce broadcasts at a frequency set by the parameter \fB"lm
interval"\fP\&. If set to \f(CW"auto"\fP Samba will not send Lanman
announce broadcasts by default but will listen for them\&. If it hears
such a broadcast on the wire it will then start sending them at a
frequency set by the parameter \fB"lm interval"\fP\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"lm interval"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	lm announce = auto\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	lm announce = true\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlm interval (G)\fP" 
.IP 
If Samba is set to produce Lanman announce broadcasts needed by
\fBOS/2\fP clients (see the \fB"lm announce"\fP
parameter) then this parameter defines the frequency in seconds with
which they will be made\&.  If this is set to zero then no Lanman
announcements will be made despite the setting of the \fB"lm
announce"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"lm announce"\fP\&.

.IP "\fBload printers (G)\fP" 
.IP 
A boolean variable that controls whether all printers in the printcap

\f(CW	load printers = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlocal master (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows \fBnmbd\fP to try and become a
local master browser on a subnet\&. If set to False then
\fBnmbd\fP will not attempt to become a local master
browser on a subnet and will also lose in all browsing elections\&. By
default this value is set to true\&. Setting this value to true doesn\'t
mean that Samba will \fIbecome\fP the local master browser on a subnet,
just that \fBnmbd\fP will \fIparticipate\fP in
elections for local master browser\&.
.IP 
Setting this value to False will cause \fBnmbd\fP
\fInever\fP to become a local master browser\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	local master = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlock dir (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"lock directory"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBlock directory (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option specifies the directory where lock files will be placed\&.
The lock files are used to implement the \fB"max

.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	lock directory = /tmp/samba\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	lock directory = /usr/local/samba/var/locks\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlocking (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls whether or not locking will be performed by the server
in response to lock requests from the client\&.
.IP 
If \f(CW"locking = no"\fP, all lock and unlock requests will appear to
succeed and all lock queries will indicate that the queried lock is
clear\&.
.IP 
If \f(CW"locking = yes"\fP, real locking will be performed by the server\&.
.IP 
This option \fImay\fP be useful for read-only filesystems which \fImay\fP
not need locking (such as cdrom drives), although setting this
parameter of \f(CW"no"\fP is not really recommended even in this case\&.
.IP 
Be careful about disabling locking either globally or in a specific
service, as lack of locking may result in data corruption\&. You should
never need to set this parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	locking = yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	locking = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlog file (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This options allows you to override the name of the Samba log file
(also known as the debug file)\&.
.IP 
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate log files for each user or machine\&.
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	log file = /usr/local/samba/var/log\&.%m\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlog level (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"debug level"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBlogon drive (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies the local path to which the home directory
will be connected (see \fB"logon home"\fP) and is only
used by NT Workstations\&. 
.IP 
Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a
\fBlogon server\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	logon drive = h:\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlogon home (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies the home directory location when a Win95/98 or
NT Workstation logs into a Samba PDC\&.  It allows you to do 
.IP 
\f(CW"NET USE H: /HOME"\fP
.IP 
from a command prompt, for example\&.
.IP 
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine\&.
.IP 
This parameter can be used with Win9X workstations to ensure that
roaming profiles are stored in a subdirectory of the user\'s home
directory\&.  This is done in the following way:
.IP 
\f(CW"     logon home = \e\e%L\e%U\eprofile"\fP
.IP 
This tells Samba to return the above string, with substitutions made
when a client requests the info, generally in a NetUserGetInfo request\&.
Win9X clients truncate the info to \e\eserver\eshare when a user does \f(CW"net use /home"\fP,
but use the whole string when dealing with profiles\&.
.IP 
Note that in prior versions of Samba, the \f(CW"logon path"\fP was returned rather than
\f(CW"logon home"\fP\&.  This broke \f(CW"net use /home"\fP but allowed profiles outside the 
home directory\&.  The current implementation is correct, and can be used for profiles
if you use the above trick\&.
.IP 
Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a
\fBlogon server\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	logon home = "\e\eremote_smb_server\e%U"\fP
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	logon home = "\e\e%N\e%U"\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlogon path (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies the home directory where roaming profiles
(NTuser\&.dat etc files for Windows NT) are stored\&.  Contrary to previous 
versions of these manual pages, it has nothing to do with Win 9X roaming
profiles\&.  To find out how to handle roaming profiles for Win 9X system, see 
the \f(CW"logon home"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine\&.  It also specifies
the directory from which the \f(CW"application data"\fP, (\f(CW"desktop"\fP, \f(CW"start menu"\fP,
\f(CW"network neighborhood"\fP, \f(CW"programs"\fP and other folders, and their
contents, are loaded and displayed on your Windows NT client\&.
.IP 
The share and the path must be readable by the user for the
preferences and directories to be loaded onto the Windows NT
client\&.  The share must be writeable when the logs in for the first
time, in order that the Windows NT client can create the NTuser\&.dat
and other directories\&.
.IP 
Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, if required, be
made read-only\&.  It is not advisable that the NTuser\&.dat file be made
read-only - rename it to NTuser\&.man to achieve the desired effect (a
\fIMAN\fPdatory profile)\&. 
.IP 
Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes]
share, even though there is no user logged in\&.  Therefore, it is vital
that the logon path does not include a reference to the homes share
(i\&.e\&. setting this parameter to \f(CW\e\e%N\eHOMES\eprofile_path\fP will cause
problems)\&.
.IP 
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine\&.
.IP 
Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a
\fBlogon server\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	logon path = \e\e%N\e%U\eprofile\fP

\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	logon path = \e\ePROFILESERVER\eHOME_DIR\e%U\ePROFILE\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBlogon script (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies the batch file (\&.bat) or NT command file
(\&.cmd) to be downloaded and run on a machine when a user successfully
logs in\&.  The file must contain the DOS style cr/lf line endings\&.
Using a DOS-style editor to create the file is recommended\&.
.IP 
The script must be a relative path to the \f(CW[netlogon]\fP service\&.  If
the \f(CW[netlogon]\fP service specifies a \fBpath\fP of
/usr/local/samba/netlogon, and logon script = STARTUP\&.BAT, then the
file that will be downloaded is:
.IP 
\f(CW/usr/local/samba/netlogon/STARTUP\&.BAT\fP
.IP 
The contents of the batch file is entirely your choice\&.  A suggested
command would be to add \f(CWNET TIME \e\eSERVER /SET /YES\fP, to force every
machine to synchronize clocks with the same time server\&.  Another use
would be to add \f(CWNET USE U: \e\eSERVER\eUTILS\fP for commonly used
utilities, or \f(CWNET USE Q: \e\eSERVER\eISO9001_QA\fP for example\&.
.IP 
Note that it is particularly important not to allow write access to
the \f(CW[netlogon]\fP share, or to grant users write permission on the
batch files in a secure environment, as this would allow the batch
files to be arbitrarily modified and security to be breached\&.
.IP 
This option takes the standard substitutions, allowing you to have
separate logon scripts for each user or machine\&.

.IP 
.IP "\fBlppause command (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies the command to be executed on the server host
in order to stop printing or spooling a specific print job\&.
.IP 
This command should be a program or script which takes a printer name
and job number to pause the print job\&. One way of implementing this is
by using job priorities, where jobs having a too low priority won\'t be
sent to the printer\&.
.IP 
If a \f(CW"%p"\fP is given then the printername is put in its place\&. A
\f(CW"%j"\fP is replaced with the job number (an integer)\&.  On HPUX (see
\fBprinting=hpux\fP), if the \f(CW"-p%p"\fP option is added
to the lpq command, the job will show up with the correct status,
i\&.e\&. if the job priority is lower than the set fence priority it will
have the PAUSED status, whereas if the priority is equal or higher it
will have the SPOOLED or PRINTING status\&.
.IP 
Note that it is good practice to include the absolute path in the
lppause command as the PATH may not be available to the server\&.
.IP

.IP "\fBlpq cache time (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls how long lpq info will be cached for to prevent the
\fBlpq\fP command being called too often\&. A separate cache is kept for
each variation of the \fBlpq\fP command used by the system, so if you
use different \fBlpq\fP commands for different users then they won\'t
share cache information\&.
.IP 
The cache files are stored in \f(CW/tmp/lpq\&.xxxx\fP where xxxx is a hash of
the \fBlpq\fP command in use\&.
.IP 
The default is 10 seconds, meaning that the cached results of a
previous identical \fBlpq\fP command will be used if the cached data is
less than 10 seconds old\&. A large value may be advisable if your
\fBlpq\fP command is very slow\&.
.IP

Currently eight styles of printer status information are supported;
BSD, AIX, LPRNG, PLP, SYSV, HPUX, QNX and SOFTQ\&. This covers most UNIX
systems\&. You control which type is expected using the

.IP 
Some clients (notably Windows for Workgroups) may not correctly send
the connection number for the printer they are requesting status
information about\&. To get around this, the server reports on the first
printer service connected to by the client\&. This only happens if the
connection number sent is invalid\&.
.IP 
If a \f(CW%p\fP is given then the printername is put in its place\&. Otherwise
it is placed at the end of the command\&.

.IP "\fBmangled map (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is for those who want to directly map UNIX file names which can
not be represented on Windows/DOS\&.  The mangling of names is not always
what is needed\&.  In particular you may have documents with file
extensions that differ between DOS and UNIX\&. For example, under UNIX
it is common to use \f(CW"\&.html"\fP for HTML files, whereas under
Windows/DOS \f(CW"\&.htm"\fP is more commonly used\&.
.IP 
So to map \f(CW"html"\fP to \f(CW"htm"\fP you would use:
.IP 
\f(CW  mangled map = (*\&.html *\&.htm)\fP
.IP 
One very useful case is to remove the annoying \f(CW";1"\fP off the ends
of filenames on some CDROMS (only visible under some UNIXs)\&. To do
this use a map of (*;1 *)\&.
.IP 
\fBdefault:\fP
\f(CW	no mangled map\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	mangled map = (*;1 *)\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmangled names (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls whether non-DOS names under UNIX should be mapped to
DOS-compatible names ("mangled") and made visible, or whether non-DOS
names should simply be ignored\&.
.IP 
See the section on \fB"NAME MANGLING"\fP for details
on how to control the mangling process\&.
.IP 
If mangling is used then the mangling algorithm is as follows:
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
The first (up to) five alphanumeric characters before the
rightmost dot of the filename are preserved, forced to upper case, and
appear as the first (up to) five characters of the mangled name\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
A tilde \f(CW"~"\fP is appended to the first part of the mangled
name, followed by a two-character unique sequence, based on the
original root name (i\&.e\&., the original filename minus its final
extension)\&. The final extension is included in the hash calculation
only if it contains any upper case characters or is longer than three
characters\&.
.IP 
Note that the character to use may be specified using the
\fB"mangling char"\fP option, if you don\'t like
\f(CW\'~\'\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
The first three alphanumeric characters of the final extension
are preserved, forced to upper case and appear as the extension of the
mangled name\&. The final extension is defined as that part of the
original filename after the rightmost dot\&. If there are no dots in the
filename, the mangled name will have no extension (except in the case
of \fB"hidden files"\fP - see below)\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
Files whose UNIX name begins with a dot will be presented as DOS
hidden files\&. The mangled name will be created as for other filenames,
but with the leading dot removed and \f(CW"___"\fP as its extension regardless
of actual original extension (that\'s three underscores)\&.
.IP 
.IP 
The two-digit hash value consists of upper case alphanumeric
characters\&.
.IP 
This algorithm can cause name collisions only if files in a directory
share the same first five alphanumeric characters\&. The probability of
such a clash is 1/1300\&.
.IP 
The name mangling (if enabled) allows a file to be copied between UNIX
directories from Windows/DOS while retaining the long UNIX
filename\&. UNIX files can be renamed to a new extension from
Windows/DOS and will retain the same basename\&. Mangled names do not
change between sessions\&.
.IP

\f(CW 	mangled names = yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	mangled names = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmangling char (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls what character is used as the \fI"magic"\fP character in
\fBname mangling\fP\&. The default is a \f(CW\'~\'\fP but
this may interfere with some software\&. Use this option to set it to
whatever you prefer\&.

.IP 
.IP "\fBmangled stack (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter controls the number of mangled names that should be
cached in the Samba server \fBsmbd\fP\&.
.IP 
This stack is a list of recently mangled base names (extensions are
only maintained if they are longer than 3 characters or contains upper
case characters)\&.
.IP 
The larger this value, the more likely it is that mangled names can be
successfully converted to correct long UNIX names\&. However, large
stack sizes will slow most directory access\&. Smaller stacks save

.IP "\fBmap archive (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls whether the DOS archive attribute should be mapped to
the UNIX owner execute bit\&.  The DOS archive bit is set when a file
has been modified since its last backup\&.  One motivation for this
option it to keep Samba/your PC from making any file it touches from
becoming executable under UNIX\&.  This can be quite annoying for shared
source code, documents, etc\&.\&.\&.
.IP 
Note that this requires the \fB"create mask"\fP
parameter to be set such that owner execute bit is not masked out
(i\&.e\&. it must include 100)\&. See the parameter \fB"create
mask"\fP for details\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW      map archive = yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW      map archive = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmap hidden (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls whether DOS style hidden files should be mapped to the
UNIX world execute bit\&.
.IP 
Note that this requires the \fB"create mask"\fP to be
set such that the world execute bit is not masked out (i\&.e\&. it must
include 001)\&. See the parameter \fB"create mask"\fP
for details\&.

.IP 
This controls whether DOS style system files should be mapped to the
UNIX group execute bit\&.
.IP 
Note that this requires the \fB"create mask"\fP to be
set such that the group execute bit is not masked out (i\&.e\&. it must
include 010)\&. See the parameter \fB"create mask"\fP

.IP "\fBmap to guest (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is only useful in \fBsecurity\fP modes
other than \fB"security=share"\fP - i\&.e\&. user,
server, and domain\&.
.IP 
This parameter can take three different values, which tell
\fBsmbd\fP what to do with user login requests that
don\'t match a valid UNIX user in some way\&.
.IP 
The three settings are :
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB"Never"\fP - Means user login requests with an invalid password
are rejected\&. This is the default\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB"Bad User"\fP - Means user logins with an invalid password are
rejected, unless the username does not exist, in which case it is
treated as a guest login and mapped into the \fB"guest
account"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fB"Bad Password"\fP - Means user logins with an invalid
password are treated as a guest login and mapped into the
\fB"guest account"\fP\&. Note that this can
cause problems as it means that any user incorrectly typing their
password will be silently logged on a \fB"guest"\fP - and 
will not know the reason they cannot access files they think
they should - there will have been no message given to them
that they got their password wrong\&. Helpdesk services will
\fI*hate*\fP you if you set the \fB"map to guest"\fP parameter
this way :-)\&.
.IP 
.IP 
Note that this parameter is needed to set up \fB"Guest"\fP share
services when using \fBsecurity\fP modes other than
share\&. This is because in these modes the name of the resource being
requested is \fI*not*\fP sent to the server until after the server has
successfully authenticated the client so the server cannot make
authentication decisions at the correct time (connection to the
share) for \fB"Guest"\fP shares\&.
.IP 
For people familiar with the older Samba releases, this parameter
maps to the old compile-time setting of the GUEST_SESSSETUP value
in local\&.h\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	map to guest = Never\fP
\fBExample\fP:
\f(CW	map to guest = Bad User\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax connections (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows the number of simultaneous connections to a service
to be limited\&. If \fB"max connections"\fP is greater than 0 then
connections will be refused if this number of connections to the
service are already open\&. A value of zero mean an unlimited number of
connections may be made\&.
.IP 
Record lock files are used to implement this feature\&. The lock files
will be stored in the directory specified by the \fB"lock
directory"\fP option\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	max connections = 0\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	max connections = 10\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax disk size (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows you to put an upper limit on the apparent size of
disks\&. If you set this option to 100 then all shares will appear to be
not larger than 100 MB in size\&.
.IP 
Note that this option does not limit the amount of data you can put on
the disk\&. In the above case you could still store much more than 100
MB on the disk, but if a client ever asks for the amount of free disk
space or the total disk size then the result will be bounded by the
amount specified in \fB"max disk size"\fP\&.
.IP 
This option is primarily useful to work around bugs in some pieces of
software that can\'t handle very large disks, particularly disks over
1GB in size\&.
.IP 
A \fB"max disk size"\fP of 0 means no limit\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	max disk size = 0\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	max disk size = 1000\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax log size (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option (an integer in kilobytes) specifies the max size the log
file should grow to\&. Samba periodically checks the size and if it is
exceeded it will rename the file, adding a \f(CW"\&.old"\fP extension\&.
.IP 
A size of 0 means no limit\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	max log size = 5000\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	max log size = 1000\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax mux (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option controls the maximum number of outstanding simultaneous
SMB operations that samba tells the client it will allow\&. You should
never need to set this parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	max mux = 50\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax open files (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter limits the maximum number of open files that one
\fBsmbd\fP file serving process may have open for
a client at any one time\&. The default for this parameter is set
very high (10,000) as Samba uses only one bit per unopened file\&.
.IP 
The limit of the number of open files is usually set by the
UNIX per-process file descriptor limit rather than this parameter
so you should never need to touch this parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	max open files = 10000\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax packet (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"packet size"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax ttl (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option tells \fBnmbd\fP what the default \'time
to live\' of NetBIOS names should be (in seconds) when
\fBnmbd\fP is requesting a name using either a
broadcast packet or from a WINS server\&. You should never need to
change this parameter\&. The default is 3 days\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	max ttl = 259200\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmax wins ttl (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option tells \fBnmbd\fP when acting as a WINS
server \fB(wins support =true)\fP what the maximum
\'time to live\' of NetBIOS names that \fBnmbd\fP will
grant will be (in seconds)\&. You should never need to change this
parameter\&.  The default is 6 days (518400 seconds)\&.

.IP 
.IP "\fBmax xmit (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option controls the maximum packet size that will be negotiated
by Samba\&. The default is 65535, which is the maximum\&. In some cases
you may find you get better performance with a smaller value\&. A value
below 2048 is likely to cause problems\&.

\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	max xmit = 8192\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmessage command (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This specifies what command to run when the server receives a WinPopup
style message\&.
.IP 
This would normally be a command that would deliver the message
somehow\&. How this is to be done is up to your imagination\&.
.IP 
An example is:
.IP 
\f(CW   message command = csh -c \'xedit %s;rm %s\' &\fP
.IP 
This delivers the message using \fBxedit\fP, then removes it
afterwards\&. \fINOTE THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMAND RETURN
IMMEDIATELY\fP\&. That\'s why I have the \f(CW\'&\'\fP on the end\&. If it doesn\'t
return immediately then your PCs may freeze when sending messages
(they should recover after 30secs, hopefully)\&.
.IP 
All messages are delivered as the global guest user\&. The command takes
the standard substitutions, although \fB%u\fP won\'t work
(\fB%U\fP may be better in this case)\&.
.IP 
Apart from the standard substitutions, some additional ones apply\&. In
particular:
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\f(CW"%s"\fP = the filename containing the message\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\f(CW"%t"\fP = the destination that the message was sent to (probably the server
name)\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\f(CW"%f"\fP = who the message is from\&.
.IP 
.IP 
You could make this command send mail, or whatever else takes your
fancy\&. Please let us know of any really interesting ideas you have\&.
.IP 
Here\'s a way of sending the messages as mail to root:
.IP 
\f(CWmessage command = /bin/mail -s \'message from %f on %m\' root < %s; rm %s\fP
.IP 
If you don\'t have a message command then the message won\'t be
delivered and Samba will tell the sender there was an
error\&. Unfortunately WfWg totally ignores the error code and carries
on regardless, saying that the message was delivered\&.
.IP 
If you want to silently delete it then try:
.IP 
\f(CW"message command = rm %s"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	no message command\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW        message command = csh -c \'xedit %s;rm %s\' &\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmin print space (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This sets the minimum amount of free disk space that must be available
before a user will be able to spool a print job\&. It is specified in
kilobytes\&. The default is 0, which means a user can always spool a print
job\&.
.IP 
See also the \fBprinting\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	min print space = 0\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	min print space = 2000\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmin passwd length (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"min password length"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBmin password length (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option sets the minimum length in characters of a plaintext password
than smbd will accept when performing UNIX password changing\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"unix password sync"\fP,
\fB"passwd program"\fP and \fB"passwd chat
debug"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	min password length = 5\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBmin wins ttl (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option tells \fBnmbd\fP when acting as a WINS
server \fB(wins support = true)\fP what the minimum
\'time to live\' of NetBIOS names that \fBnmbd\fP will
grant will be (in seconds)\&. You should never need to change this
parameter\&.  The default is 6 hours (21600 seconds)\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	min wins ttl = 21600\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBname resolve order (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option is used by the programs in the Samba suite to determine
what naming services and in what order to resolve host names to IP
addresses\&. The option takes a space separated string of different name
resolution options\&.
.IP 
The options are :"lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast"\&. They cause
names to be resolved as follows :
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBlmhosts\fP : Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file\&.
If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS
name (see the \fBlmhosts (5)\fP for details) then
any name type matches for lookup\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBhost\fP : Do a standard host name to IP address resolution,
using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups\&. This method of name
resolution is operating system depended for instance on IRIX or
Solaris this may be controlled by the \fI/etc/nsswitch\&.conf\fP file)\&.
Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being
queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBwins\fP : Query a name with the IP address listed in the
\fBwins server\fP parameter\&. If no WINS server has
been specified this method will be ignored\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
\fBbcast\fP : Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces
listed in the \fBinterfaces\fP parameter\&. This is the
least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the
target host being on a locally connected subnet\&.
.IP 
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	name resolve order = lmhosts bcast host\fP
.IP 
This will cause the local lmhosts file to be examined first, followed
by a broadcast attempt, followed by a normal system hostname lookup\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBnetbios aliases (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of NetBIOS names that \fBnmbd\fP will
advertise as additional names by which the Samba server is known\&. This
allows one machine to appear in browse lists under multiple names\&. If
a machine is acting as a \fBbrowse server\fP or
\fBlogon server\fP none of these names will be
advertised as either browse server or logon servers, only the primary
name of the machine will be advertised with these capabilities\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"netbios name"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	empty string (no additional names)\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	netbios aliases = TEST TEST1 TEST2\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBnetbios name (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This sets the NetBIOS name by which a Samba server is known\&. By
default it is the same as the first component of the host\'s DNS name\&.
If a machine is a \fBbrowse server\fP or
\fBlogon server\fP this name (or the first component
of the hosts DNS name) will be the name that these services are
advertised under\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"netbios aliases"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	Machine DNS name\&.\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	netbios name = MYNAME\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBnetbios scope (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This sets the NetBIOS scope that Samba will operate under\&. This should
not be set unless every machine on your LAN also sets this value\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBnis homedir (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Get the home share server from a NIS map\&. For UNIX systems that use an
automounter, the user\'s home directory will often be mounted on a
workstation on demand from a remote server\&. 
.IP 
When the Samba logon server is not the actual home directory server,
but is mounting the home directories via NFS then two network hops
would be required to access the users home directory if the logon
server told the client to use itself as the SMB server for home
directories (one over SMB and one over NFS)\&. This can be very
slow\&.
.IP 
This option allows Samba to return the home share as being on a
different server to the logon server and as long as a Samba daemon is
running on the home directory server, it will be mounted on the Samba
client directly from the directory server\&. When Samba is returning the
home share to the client, it will consult the NIS map specified in
\fB"homedir map"\fP and return the server listed
there\&.
.IP 
Note that for this option to work there must be a working NIS
system and the Samba server with this option must also be a
\fBlogon server\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	nis homedir = false\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	nis homedir = true\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBnt acl support (G)\fP"

.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	nt acl support = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBnt pipe support (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter controls whether \fBsmbd\fP
will allow Windows NT clients to connect to the NT SMB specific
\f(CWIPC$\fP pipes\&. This is a developer debugging option and can be left
alone\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	nt pipe support = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBnt smb support (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter controls whether \fBsmbd\fP
will negotiate NT specific SMB support with Windows NT
clients\&. Although this is a developer debugging option and should be
left alone, benchmarking has discovered that Windows NT clients give
faster performance with this option set to \f(CW"no"\fP\&. This is still
being investigated\&. If this option is set to \f(CW"no"\fP then Samba
offers exactly the same SMB calls that versions prior to Samba2\&.0
offered\&. This information may be of use if any users are having
problems with NT SMB support\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	nt support = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBnull passwords (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Allow or disallow client access to accounts that have null passwords\&. 
.IP 
See also \fBsmbpasswd (5)\fP\&.

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	null passwords = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	null passwords = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBole locking compatibility (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter allows an administrator to turn off the byte range lock
manipulation that is done within Samba to give compatibility for OLE
applications\&. Windows OLE applications use byte range locking as a
form of inter-process communication, by locking ranges of bytes around
the 2^32 region of a file range\&. This can cause certain UNIX lock
managers to crash or otherwise cause problems\&. Setting this parameter
to \f(CW"no"\fP means you trust your UNIX lock manager to handle such cases
correctly\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	ole locking compatibility = yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	ole locking compatibility = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBonly guest (S)\fP" 
.IP 
A synonym for \fB"guest only"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBonly user (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a boolean option that controls whether connections with
usernames not in the \fBuser=\fP list will be allowed\&. By
default this option is disabled so a client can supply a username to
be used by the server\&.
.IP 
Note that this also means Samba won\'t try to deduce usernames from the
service name\&. This can be annoying for the \fB[homes]\fP
section\&. To get around this you could use "\fBuser\fP =
\fB%S\fP" which means your \fB"user"\fP list
will be just the service name, which for home directories is the name
of the user\&.
.IP 
See also the \fBuser\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	only user = False\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	only user = True\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBoplocks (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean option tells smbd whether to issue oplocks (opportunistic
locks) to file open requests on this share\&. The oplock code can
dramatically (approx\&. 30% or more) improve the speed of access to files
on Samba servers\&. It allows the clients to aggressively cache files
locally and you may want to disable this option for unreliable network
environments (it is turned on by default in Windows NT Servers)\&.  For
more information see the file Speed\&.txt in the Samba docs/ directory\&.
.IP 
Oplocks may be selectively turned off on certain files on a per share basis\&.
See the \'veto oplock files\' parameter\&. On some systems oplocks are recognized
by the underlying operating system\&. This allows data synchronization between
all access to oplocked files, whether it be via Samba or NFS or a local
UNIX process\&. See the \fBkernel oplocks\fP parameter
for details\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"kernel oplocks"\fP and
\fB"level2 oplocks"\fP parameters\&.

\f(CW	oplocks = True\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	oplocks = False\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBoplock break wait time (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a tuning parameter added due to bugs in both Windows 9x and WinNT\&.
If Samba responds to a client too quickly when that client issues an SMB that
can cause an oplock break request, then the client redirector can fail and
not respond to the break request\&. This tuning parameter (which is set in
milliseconds) is the amount of time Samba will wait before sending an
oplock break request to such (broken) clients\&.
.IP 
\fIDO NOT CHANGE THIS PARAMETER UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE SAMBA
OPLOCK CODE\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	oplock break wait time = 10\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBoplock contention limit (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a \fIvery\fP advanced \fBsmbd\fP tuning option to improve
the efficiency of the granting of oplocks under multiple client contention for the same file\&.
.IP 
In brief it specifies a number, which causes smbd not to grant an oplock even
when requested if the approximate number of clients contending for an oplock on
the same file goes over this limit\&. This causes \fBsmbd\fP to
behave in a similar way to Windows NT\&.
.IP 
\fIDO NOT CHANGE THIS PARAMETER UNLESS YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE SAMBA
OPLOCK CODE\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW oplock contention limit = 2\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBos level (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This integer value controls what level Samba advertises itself as for
browse elections\&. The value of this parameter determines whether
\fBnmbd\fP has a chance of becoming a local master
browser for the \fBWORKGROUP\fP in the local broadcast
area\&. The default is zero, which means \fBnmbd\fP will
lose elections to Windows machines\&. See BROWSING\&.txt in the Samba
docs/ directory for details\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	os level = 20\fP

\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	os level = 65    ; This will win against any NT Server\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpacket size (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a deprecated parameter that has no effect on the current
Samba code\&. It is left in the parameter list to prevent breaking
old \fBsmb\&.conf\fP files\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBpanic action (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a Samba developer option that allows a system command to be
called when either \fBsmbd\fP or
\fBnmbd\fP crashes\&. This is usually used to draw
attention to the fact that a problem occurred\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	panic action = <empty string>\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpasswd chat (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This string controls the \fI"chat"\fP conversation that takes places
between \fBsmbd\fP and the local password changing
program to change the users password\&. The string describes a sequence
of response-receive pairs that \fBsmbd\fP uses to
determine what to send to the \fBpasswd\fP program
and what to expect back\&. If the expected output is not received then
the password is not changed\&.
.IP 
This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending on what
local methods are used for password control (such as NIS etc)\&.
.IP 
The string can contain the macros \f(CW"%o"\fP and \f(CW"%n"\fP which are
substituted for the old and new passwords respectively\&. It can also
contain the standard macros \f(CW"\en"\fP, \f(CW"\er"\fP, \f(CW"\et"\fP and \f(CW"\es"\fP
to give line-feed, carriage-return, tab and space\&.
.IP 
The string can also contain a \f(CW\'*\'\fP which matches any sequence of
characters\&.
.IP 
Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces in them into
a single string\&.
.IP 
If the send string in any part of the chat sequence is a fullstop
\f(CW"\&."\fP  then no string is sent\&. Similarly, is the expect string is a
fullstop then no string is expected\&.
.IP 
Note that if the \fB"unix password sync"\fP
parameter is set to true, then this sequence is called \fI*AS ROOT*\fP
when the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is being changed, without
access to the old password cleartext\&. In this case the old password
cleartext is set to \f(CW""\fP (the empty string)\&.
.IP

.IP 
.IP "\fBpasswd chat debug (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean specifies if the passwd chat script parameter is run in
\f(CW"debug"\fP mode\&. In this mode the strings passed to and received from
the passwd chat are printed in the \fBsmbd\fP log with
a \fB"debug level"\fP of 100\&. This is a dangerous
option as it will allow plaintext passwords to be seen in the
\fBsmbd\fP log\&. It is available to help Samba admins
debug their \fB"passwd chat"\fP scripts when calling
the \fB"passwd program"\fP and should be turned off

.IP 
.IP "\fBpasswd program (G)\fP" 
.IP 
The name of a program that can be used to set UNIX user passwords\&.
Any occurrences of \fB%u\fP will be replaced with the
user name\&. The user name is checked for existence before calling the
password changing program\&.
.IP 
Also note that many passwd programs insist in \fI"reasonable"\fP
passwords, such as a minimum length, or the inclusion of mixed case
chars and digits\&. This can pose a problem as some clients (such as
Windows for Workgroups) uppercase the password before sending it\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that if the \fB"unix password sync"\fP
parameter is set to \f(CW"True"\fP then this program is called \fI*AS
ROOT*\fP before the SMB password in the
\fBsmbpasswd\fP file is changed\&. If this UNIX
password change fails, then \fBsmbd\fP will fail to
change the SMB password also (this is by design)\&.
.IP 
If the \fB"unix password sync"\fP parameter is
set this parameter \fIMUST USE ABSOLUTE PATHS\fP for \fIALL\fP programs
called, and must be examined for security implications\&. Note that by
default \fB"unix password sync"\fP is set to
\f(CW"False"\fP\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"unix password sync"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	passwd program = /bin/passwd\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	passwd program = /sbin/passwd %u\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpassword level (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Some client/server combinations have difficulty with mixed-case
passwords\&.  One offending client is Windows for Workgroups, which for
some reason forces passwords to upper case when using the LANMAN1
protocol, but leaves them alone when using COREPLUS!
.IP 
This parameter defines the maximum number of characters that may be
upper case in passwords\&.
.IP 
For example, say the password given was \f(CW"FRED"\fP\&. If \fBpassword
level\fP is set to 1, the following combinations would be tried if
\f(CW"FRED"\fP failed:
.IP 
\f(CW"Fred"\fP, \f(CW"fred"\fP, \f(CW"fRed"\fP, \f(CW"frEd"\fP, \f(CW"freD"\fP
.IP 
If \fBpassword level\fP was set to 2, the following combinations would
also be tried: 
.IP 
\f(CW"FRed"\fP, \f(CW"FrEd"\fP, \f(CW"FreD"\fP, \f(CW"fREd"\fP, \f(CW"fReD"\fP,
\f(CW"frED"\fP, \f(CW\&.\&.\fP
.IP 
And so on\&.
.IP 
The higher value this parameter is set to the more likely it is that a
mixed case password will be matched against a single case
password\&. However, you should be aware that use of this parameter
reduces security and increases the time taken to process a new
connection\&.
.IP 
A value of zero will cause only two attempts to be made - the password
as is and the password in all-lower case\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	password level = 0\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	password level = 4\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpassword server (G)\fP" 
.IP 
By specifying the name of another SMB server (such as a WinNT box)
with this option, and using \fB"security = domain"\fP or
\fB"security = server"\fP you can get Samba to do all
its username/password validation via a remote server\&.
.IP 
This options sets the name of the password server to use\&. It must be a
NetBIOS name, so if the machine\'s NetBIOS name is different from its
internet name then you may have to add its NetBIOS name to the lmhosts 
file which is stored in the same directory as the \fBsmb\&.conf\fP file\&.
.IP 
The name of the password server is looked up using the parameter
\fB"name resolve order="\fP and so may resolved
by any method and order described in that parameter\&.
.IP 
The password server much be a machine capable of using the "LM1\&.2X002"
or the "LM NT 0\&.12" protocol, and it must be in user level security
mode\&. 
.IP 
NOTE: Using a password server means your UNIX box (running Samba) is
only as secure as your password server\&. \fIDO NOT CHOOSE A PASSWORD
SERVER THAT YOU DON\'T COMPLETELY TRUST\fP\&.
.IP 
Never point a Samba server at itself for password serving\&. This will
cause a loop and could lock up your Samba server!
.IP 
The name of the password server takes the standard substitutions, but
probably the only useful one is \fB%m\fP, which means
the Samba server will use the incoming client as the password
server\&. If you use this then you better trust your clients, and you
better restrict them with hosts allow!
.IP 
If the \fB"security"\fP parameter is set to
\fB"domain"\fP, then the list of machines in this option must be a list
of Primary or Backup Domain controllers for the
\fBDomain\fP or the character \f(CW*\fP, as the Samba server is cryptographicly
in that domain, and will use cryptographicly authenticated RPC calls
to authenticate the user logging on\&. The advantage of using
\fB"security=domain"\fP is that if you list
several hosts in the \fB"password server"\fP option then
\fBsmbd\fP will try each in turn till it finds one
that responds\&. This is useful in case your primary server goes down\&.
.IP 
If the \fB"password server"\fP option is set to the character \f(CW*\fP,
then Samba will attempt to auto-locate the Primary or Backup Domain controllers
to authenticate against by doing a query for the name \f(CWWORKGROUP<1C>\fP
and then contacting each server returned in the list of IP addresses
from the \fBname resolution\fP source\&.
.IP 
If the \fB"security"\fP parameter is set to
\fB"server"\fP, then there are different
restrictions that \fB"security=domain"\fP
doesn\'t suffer from:
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
You may list several password servers in the \fB"password server"\fP
parameter, however if an \fBsmbd\fP makes a connection
to a password server, and then the password server fails, no more
users will be able to be authenticated from this
\fBsmbd\fP\&.  This is a restriction of the SMB/CIFS
protocol when in \fB"security=server"\fP mode
and cannot be fixed in Samba\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
If you are using a Windows NT server as your password server then
you will have to ensure that your users are able to login from the
Samba server, as when in
\fB"security=server"\fP mode the network
logon will appear to come from there rather than from the users
workstation\&.
.IP 
.IP 
See also the \fB"security"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	password server = <empty string>\fP

\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	password server = *\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpath (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter specifies a directory to which the user of the service
is to be given access\&. In the case of printable services, this is
where print data will spool prior to being submitted to the host for
printing\&.
.IP 
For a printable service offering guest access, the service should be
readonly and the path should be world-writeable and have the sticky bit
set\&. This is not mandatory of course, but you probably won\'t get the
results you expect if you do otherwise\&.
.IP 
Any occurrences of \fB%u\fP in the path will be replaced
with the UNIX username that the client is using on this
connection\&. Any occurrences of \fB%m\fP will be replaced
by the NetBIOS name of the machine they are connecting from\&. These
replacements are very useful for setting up pseudo home directories
for users\&.
.IP 
Note that this path will be based on \fB"root dir"\fP if
one was specified\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	none\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	path = /home/fred\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpostexec (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This option specifies a command to be run whenever the service is
disconnected\&. It takes the usual substitutions\&. The command may be run
as the root on some systems\&.
.IP 
An interesting example may be do unmount server resources:
.IP 
\f(CWpostexec = /etc/umount /cdrom\fP
.IP 
See also \fBpreexec\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW      none (no command executed)\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW      postexec = echo "%u disconnected from %S from %m (%I)" >> /tmp/log\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpostscript (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter forces a printer to interpret the print files as
postscript\&. This is done by adding a \f(CW%!\fP to the start of print output\&.
.IP 
This is most useful when you have lots of PCs that persist in putting
a control-D at the start of print jobs, which then confuses your
printer\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	postscript = False\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	postscript = True\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpreexec (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This option specifies a command to be run whenever the service is
connected to\&. It takes the usual substitutions\&.
.IP 
An interesting example is to send the users a welcome message every
time they log in\&. Maybe a message of the day? Here is an example:
.IP 

.DS 
 

	preexec = csh -c \'echo \e"Welcome to %S!\e" | /usr/local/samba/bin/smbclient -M %m -I %I\' &

.DE 
 

.IP 
Of course, this could get annoying after a while :-)
.IP

\f(CW        preexec = echo \e"%u connected to %S from %m (%I)\e" >> /tmp/log\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpreexec close (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean option controls whether a non-zero return code from
\fB"preexec"\fP should close the service being connected to\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	preexec close = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	preexec close = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBpreferred master (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter controls if \fBnmbd\fP is a
preferred master browser for its workgroup\&.
.IP 
If this is set to true, on startup, \fBnmbd\fP will
force an election, and it will have a slight advantage in winning the
election\&.  It is recommended that this parameter is used in
conjunction with \fB"domain master = yes"\fP, so
that \fBnmbd\fP can guarantee becoming a domain
master\&.
.IP 
Use this option with caution, because if there are several hosts
(whether Samba servers, Windows 95 or NT) that are preferred master
browsers on the same subnet, they will each periodically and
continuously attempt to become the local master browser\&.  This will
result in unnecessary broadcast traffic and reduced browsing
capabilities\&.
.IP

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW       preserve case = yes\fP
.IP 
See the section on \fB"NAME MANGLING"\fP for a
fuller discussion\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBprint command (S)\fP" 
.IP 
After a print job has finished spooling to a service, this command
will be used via a \f(CWsystem()\fP call to process the spool
file\&. Typically the command specified will submit the spool file to
the host\'s printing subsystem, but there is no requirement that this
be the case\&. The server will not remove the spool file, so whatever
command you specify should remove the spool file when it has been
processed, otherwise you will need to manually remove old spool files\&.
.IP 
The print command is simply a text string\&. It will be used verbatim,
with two exceptions: All occurrences of \f(CW"%s"\fP and \f(CW"%f"\fP will be
replaced by the appropriate spool file name, and all occurrences of
\f(CW"%p"\fP will be replaced by the appropriate printer name\&. The spool
file name is generated automatically by the server, the printer name
is discussed below\&.
.IP 
The print command \fIMUST\fP contain at least one occurrence of \f(CW"%s"\fP
or \f(CW"%f"\fP - the \f(CW"%p"\fP is optional\&. At the time a job is
submitted, if no printer name is supplied the \f(CW"%p"\fP will be
silently removed from the printer command\&.
.IP 
If specified in the \fB"[global]"\fP section, the print
command given will be used for any printable service that does not
have its own print command specified\&.
.IP 
If there is neither a specified print command for a printable service
nor a global print command, spool files will be created but not
processed and (most importantly) not removed\&.
.IP 
Note that printing may fail on some UNIXs from the \f(CW"nobody"\fP
account\&. If this happens then create an alternative guest account that
can print and set the \fB"guest account"\fP in the
\fB"[global]"\fP section\&.
.IP 
You can form quite complex print commands by realizing that they are
just passed to a shell\&. For example the following will log a print
job, print the file, then remove it\&. Note that \f(CW\';\'\fP is the usual
separator for command in shell scripts\&.
.IP 
\f(CWprint command = echo Printing %s >> /tmp/print\&.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s\fP
.IP 
You may have to vary this command considerably depending on how you
normally print files on your system\&. The default for the parameter
varies depending on the setting of the \fB"printing="\fP
parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
For \fB"printing="\fP BSD, AIX, QNX, LPRNG or PLP :
\f(CW	print command = lpr -r -P%p %s\fP

Synonym for \fBprintable\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBprintable (S)\fP" 
.IP 
If this parameter is \f(CW"yes"\fP, then clients may open, write to and
submit spool files on the directory specified for the service\&.
.IP 
Note that a printable service will ALWAYS allow writing to the service
path (user privileges permitting) via the spooling of print data\&. The
\fB"writeable"\fP parameter controls only non-printing
access to the resource\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	printable = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	printable = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBprintcap (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fBprintcapname\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBprintcap name (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter may be used to override the compiled-in default
printcap name used by the server (usually /etc/printcap)\&. See the
discussion of the \fB[printers]\fP section above for
reasons why you might want to do this\&.
.IP 
On System V systems that use \fBlpstat\fP to list available printers you
can use \f(CW"printcap name = lpstat"\fP to automatically obtain lists of
available printers\&. This is the default for systems that define SYSV
at configure time in Samba (this includes most System V based
systems)\&. If \fB"printcap name"\fP is set to \fBlpstat\fP on these systems
then Samba will launch \f(CW"lpstat -v"\fP and attempt to parse the output
to obtain a printer list\&.
.IP 
A minimal printcap file would look something like this:
.IP 

.DS 
 

	print1|My Printer 1
	print2|My Printer 2
	print3|My Printer 3
	print4|My Printer 4
	print5|My Printer 5

.DE 
 

.IP 
where the \f(CW\'|\'\fP separates aliases of a printer\&. The fact that the
second alias has a space in it gives a hint to Samba that it\'s a
comment\&.
.IP 
\fINOTE\fP: Under AIX the default printcap name is
\f(CW"/etc/qconfig"\fP\&. Samba will assume the file is in AIX \f(CW"qconfig"\fP
format if the string \f(CW"/qconfig"\fP appears in the printcap filename\&.

.IP 
This option allows you to control the string that clients receive when
they ask the server for the printer driver associated with a
printer\&. If you are using Windows95 or WindowsNT then you can use this
to automate the setup of printers on your system\&.
.IP 
You need to set this parameter to the exact string (case sensitive)
that describes the appropriate printer driver for your system\&. If you
don\'t know the exact string to use then you should first try with no
\fB"printer driver"\fP option set and the client will give you a list of

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	read prediction = False\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBread raw (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter controls whether or not the server will support the raw
read SMB requests when transferring data to clients\&.
.IP 
If enabled, raw reads allow reads of 65535 bytes in one packet\&. This
typically provides a major performance benefit\&.
.IP 
However, some clients either negotiate the allowable block size
incorrectly or are incapable of supporting larger block sizes, and for

SMBreadbraw) is larger than this value then the server begins writing
the data before it has received the whole packet from the network, or
in the case of SMBreadbraw, it begins writing to the network before
all the data has been read from disk\&.
.IP 
This overlapping works best when the speeds of disk and network access
are similar, having very little effect when the speed of one is much
greater than the other\&.
.IP 
The default value is 16384, but very little experimentation has been
done yet to determine the optimal value, and it is likely that the
best value will vary greatly between systems anyway\&. A value over
65536 is pointless and will cause you to allocate memory
unnecessarily\&.

.IP "\fBremote announce (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows you to setup \fBnmbd\fP to
periodically announce itself to arbitrary IP addresses with an
arbitrary workgroup name\&.
.IP 
This is useful if you want your Samba server to appear in a remote
workgroup for which the normal browse propagation rules don\'t
work\&. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can send IP
packets to\&.
.IP 
For example:
.IP 
\f(CW	remote announce = 192\&.168\&.2\&.255/SERVERS 192\&.168\&.4\&.255/STAFF\fP
.IP 
the above line would cause nmbd to announce itself to the two given IP
addresses using the given workgroup names\&. If you leave out the
workgroup name then the one given in the
\fB"workgroup"\fP parameter is used instead\&.
.IP 
The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses
of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known
browse masters if your network config is that stable\&.
.IP 
See the documentation file BROWSING\&.txt in the docs/ directory\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	remote announce = <empty string>\fP

\f(CW	remote announce = 192\&.168\&.2\&.255/SERVERS 192\&.168\&.4\&.255/STAFF\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBremote browse sync (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows you to setup \fBnmbd\fP to
periodically request synchronization of browse lists with the master
browser of a samba server that is on a remote segment\&. This option
will allow you to gain browse lists for multiple workgroups across
routed networks\&. This is done in a manner that does not work with any
non-samba servers\&.
.IP 
This is useful if you want your Samba server and all local clients to
appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation
rules don\'t work\&. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can
send IP packets to\&.
.IP 
For example:
.IP 
\f(CW	remote browse sync = 192\&.168\&.2\&.255 192\&.168\&.4\&.255\fP
.IP 
the above line would cause \fBnmbd\fP to request the
master browser on the specified subnets or addresses to synchronize
their browse lists with the local server\&.
.IP 
The IP addresses you choose would normally be the broadcast addresses
of the remote networks, but can also be the IP addresses of known
browse masters if your network config is that stable\&. If a machine IP
address is given Samba makes NO attempt to validate that the remote
machine is available, is listening, nor that it is in fact the browse
master on it\'s segment\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	remote browse sync = <empty string>\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	remote browse sync = 192\&.168\&.2\&.255 192\&.168\&.4\&.255\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBrestrict anonymous (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a boolean parameter\&.  If it is true, then anonymous access
to the server will be restricted, namely in the case where the server
is expecting the client to send a username, but it doesn\'t\&.  Setting
it to true will force these anonymous connections to be denied, and
the client will be required to always supply a username and password
when connecting\&. Use of this parameter is only recommened for homogenous 
NT client environments\&.
.IP 
This parameter makes the use of macro expansions that rely
on the username (%U, %G, etc) consistant\&.  NT 4\&.0 likes to use
anonymous connections when refreshing the share list, and this
is a way to work around that\&.
.IP 
When restrict anonymous is true, all anonymous connections are denied
no matter what they are for\&.  This can effect the ability of a machine
to access the samba Primary Domain Controller to revalidate it\'s machine
account after someone else has logged on the client interactively\&.  The
NT client will display a message saying that the machine\'s account in 
the domain doesn\'t exist or the password is bad\&.  The best way to deal 
with this is to reboot NT client machines between interactive logons, 
using "Shutdown and Restart", rather than "Close all programs and logon 
as a different user"\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW     restrict anonymous = false\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW     restrict anonymous = true\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBrevalidate (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Note that this option only works with
\fB"security=share"\fP and will be ignored if
this is not the case\&.
.IP 
This option controls whether Samba will allow a previously validated
username/password pair to be used to attach to a share\&. Thus if you
connect to \f(CW\e\eserver\eshare1\fP then to \f(CW\e\eserver\eshare2\fP it won\'t
automatically allow the client to request connection to the second
share as the same username as the first without a password\&.
.IP 
If \fB"revalidate"\fP is \f(CW"True"\fP then the client will be denied
automatic access as the same username\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	revalidate = False\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	revalidate = True\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBroot (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"root directory"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBroot dir (G)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"root directory"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBroot directory (G)\fP" 
.IP 
The server will \f(CW"chroot()"\fP (i\&.e\&. Change it\'s root directory) to
this directory on startup\&. This is not strictly necessary for secure
operation\&. Even without it the server will deny access to files not in
one of the service entries\&. It may also check for, and deny access to,
soft links to other parts of the filesystem, or attempts to use
\f(CW"\&.\&."\fP in file names to access other directories (depending on the
setting of the \fB"wide links"\fP parameter)\&.
.IP 
Adding a \fB"root directory"\fP entry other than \f(CW"/"\fP adds an extra
level of security, but at a price\&. It absolutely ensures that no
access is given to files not in the sub-tree specified in the \fB"root
directory"\fP option, \fI*including*\fP some files needed for complete
operation of the server\&. To maintain full operability of the server
you will need to mirror some system files into the \fB"root
directory"\fP tree\&. In particular you will need to mirror /etc/passwd
(or a subset of it), and any binaries or configuration files needed
for printing (if required)\&. The set of files that must be mirrored is
operating system dependent\&.

\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	root directory = /homes/smb\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBroot postexec (S)\fP"

.IP 
.IP "\fBsecurity (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option affects how clients respond to Samba and is one of the most
important settings in the \fBsmb\&.conf\fP file\&.
.IP 
The option sets the \f(CW"security mode bit"\fP in replies to protocol
negotiations with \fBsmbd\fP to turn share level
security on or off\&. Clients decide based on this bit whether (and how)
to transfer user and password information to the server\&.
.IP 
The default is "security=user", as this is
the most common setting needed when talking to Windows 98 and Windows
NT\&.
.IP 
The alternatives are \fB"security = share"\fP,
\fB"security = server"\fP or
\fB"security=domain"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fI*****NOTE THAT THIS DEFAULT IS DIFFERENT IN SAMBA2\&.0 THAN FOR
PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF SAMBA *******\fP\&.
.IP 
In previous versions of Samba the default was
\fB"security=share"\fP mainly because that was
the only option at one stage\&.
.IP 
There is a bug in WfWg that has relevance to this setting\&. When in
user or server level security a WfWg client will totally ignore the
password you type in the "connect drive" dialog box\&. This makes it
very difficult (if not impossible) to connect to a Samba service as
anyone except the user that you are logged into WfWg as\&.
.IP 
If your PCs use usernames that are the same as their usernames on the
UNIX machine then you will want to use \fB"security = user"\fP\&. If you
mostly use usernames that don\'t exist on the UNIX box then use
\fB"security = share"\fP\&.
.IP 
You should also use \fBsecurity=share\fP if
you want to mainly setup shares without a password (guest
shares)\&. This is commonly used for a shared printer server\&. It is more
difficult to setup guest shares with
\fBsecurity=user\fP, see the \fB"map to
guest"\fPparameter for details\&.
.IP 
It is possible to use \fBsmbd\fP in a \fI"hybrid
mode"\fP where it is offers both user and share level security under
different \fBNetBIOS aliases\fP\&. See the
\fBNetBIOS aliases\fP and the
\fBinclude\fP parameters for more information\&.
.IP 
The different settings will now be explained\&.
.IP 
.IP 
.IP "\fB"security=share"\fP" 
When clients connect to a share level
security server then need not log onto the server with a valid
username and password before attempting to connect to a shared
resource (although modern clients such as Windows 95/98 and Windows NT
will send a logon request with a username but no password when talking
to a \fBsecurity=share\fP server)\&. Instead, the clients send
authentication information (passwords) on a per-share basis, at the
time they attempt to connect to that share\&.
.IP 
Note that \fBsmbd\fP \fI*ALWAYS*\fP uses a valid UNIX
user to act on behalf of the client, even in \fB"security=share"\fP
level security\&.
.IP 
As clients are not required to send a username to the server
in share level security, \fBsmbd\fP uses several
techniques to determine the correct UNIX user to use on behalf
of the client\&.
.IP 
A list of possible UNIX usernames to match with the given
client password is constructed using the following methods :
.IP 
.IP 
.IP o 
If the \fB"guest only"\fP parameter is set, then
all the other stages are missed and only the \fB"guest
account"\fP username is checked\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
Is a username is sent with the share connection request, then
this username (after mapping - see \fB"username
map"\fP), is added as a potential username\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
If the client did a previous \fI"logon"\fP request (the
SessionSetup SMB call) then the username sent in this SMB
will be added as a potential username\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
The name of the service the client requested is added
as a potential username\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
The NetBIOS name of the client is added to the list as a
potential username\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
Any users on the \fB"user"\fP list are added
as potential usernames\&.
.IP 
.IP 
If the \fB"guest only"\fP parameter is not set, then
this list is then tried with the supplied password\&. The first user for
whom the password matches will be used as the UNIX user\&.
.IP 
If the \fB"guest only"\fP parameter is set, or no
username can be determined then if the share is marked as available to
the \fB"guest account"\fP, then this guest user will
be used, otherwise access is denied\&.
.IP 
Note that it can be \fI*very*\fP confusing in share-level security as to
which UNIX username will eventually be used in granting access\&.
.IP 
See also the section \fB"NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD
VALIDATION"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB"security=user"\fP" 
.IP 
This is the default security setting in Samba2\&.0\&. With user-level
security a client must first \f(CW"log-on"\fP with a valid username and
password (which can be mapped using the \fB"username
map"\fP parameter)\&. Encrypted passwords (see the
\fB"encrypted passwords"\fP parameter) can also
be used in this security mode\&. Parameters such as
\fB"user"\fP and \fB"guest only"\fP, if set
are then applied and may change the UNIX user to use on this
connection, but only after the user has been successfully
authenticated\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that the name of the resource being requested is
\fI*not*\fP sent to the server until after the server has successfully
authenticated the client\&. This is why guest shares don\'t work in user
level security without allowing the server to automatically map unknown
users into the \fB"guest account"\fP\&. See the
\fB"map to guest"\fP parameter for details on
doing this\&.
.IP 
See also the section \fB"NOTE ABOUT USERNAME/PASSWORD
VALIDATION"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB"security=server"\fP" 
.IP 
In this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by
passing it to another SMB server, such as an NT box\&. If this fails it
will revert to \fB"security = user"\fP, but note that if encrypted
passwords have been negotiated then Samba cannot revert back to
checking the UNIX password file, it must have a valid smbpasswd file
to check users against\&. See the documentation file in the docs/
directory ENCRYPTION\&.txt for details on how to set this up\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that from the clients point of view \fB"security=server"\fP is
the same as \fB"security=user"\fP\&. It only
affects how the server deals with the authentication, it does not in
any way affect what the client sees\&.

\fBsmbpasswd\fP has been used to add this machine
into a Windows NT Domain\&. It expects the \fB"encrypted
passwords"\fP parameter to be set to \f(CW"true"\fP\&. In
this mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing
it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly the
same way that a Windows NT Server would do\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that a valid UNIX user must still exist as well as the
account on the Domain Controller to allow Samba to have a valid
UNIX account to map file access to\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that from the clients point of view \fB"security=domain"\fP is
the same as \fB"security=user"\fP\&. It only

.IP 
\fINote\fP that the name of the resource being requested is

.IP 
\fIBUG:\fP There is currently a bug in the implementation of
\fB"security=domain\fP with respect to multi-byte character

This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits can be modified
when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX permission on a
file using the native NT security dialog box\&.
.IP 
This parameter is applied as a mask (AND\'ed with) to the changed
permission bits, thus preventing any bits not in this mask from
being modified\&. Essentially, zero bits in this mask may be treated
as a set of bits the user is not allowed to change\&.
.IP 
If not set explicitly this parameter is set to the same value as the
\fBcreate mask\fP parameter\&. To allow a user to
modify all the user/group/world permissions on a file, set this
parameter to 0777\&.
.IP 
\fINote\fP that users who can access the Samba server through other

.IP 
Socket options are controls on the networking layer of the operating
systems which allow the connection to be tuned\&.
.IP 
This option will typically be used to tune your Samba server for
optimal performance for your local network\&. There is no way that Samba
can know what the optimal parameters are for your net, so you must
experiment and choose them yourself\&. We strongly suggest you read the
appropriate documentation for your operating system first (perhaps
\fB"man setsockopt"\fP will help)\&.
.IP 
You may find that on some systems Samba will say "Unknown socket
option" when you supply an option\&. This means you either incorrectly 
typed it or you need to add an include file to includes\&.h for your OS\&. 
If the latter is the case please send the patch to
samba@samba\&.org\&.

.IP 
This variable enables or disables the entire SSL mode\&. If it is set to
"no", the SSL enabled samba behaves exactly like the non-SSL samba\&. If
set to "yes", it depends on the variables \fB"ssl

This variable is a second way to define the trusted CAs\&. The
certificates of the trusted CAs are collected in one big file and this
variable points to the file\&. You will probably only use one of the two
ways to define your CAs\&. The first choice is preferable if you have
many CAs or want to be flexible, the second is preferable if you only
have one CA and want to keep things simple (you won\'t need to create
the hashed file names)\&. You don\'t need this variable if you don\'t

These two variables define whether samba will go into SSL mode or
not\&. If none of them is defined, samba will allow only SSL
connections\&. If the \fB"ssl hosts"\fP variable lists
hosts (by IP-address, IP-address range, net group or name), only these
hosts will be forced into SSL mode\&. If the \fB"ssl hosts resign"\fP
variable lists hosts, only these hosts will NOT be forced into SSL
mode\&. The syntax for these two variables is the same as for the
\fB"hosts allow"\fP and \fB"hosts
deny"\fP pair of variables, only that the subject of the
decision is different: It\'s not the access right but whether SSL is
used or not\&. See the \fB"allow hosts"\fP parameter for

variable is set to \f(CW"no"\fP, clients don\'t need certificates\&. Contrary
to web applications you really \fI*should*\fP require client
certificates\&. In the web environment the client\'s data is sensitive
(credit card numbers) and the server must prove to be trustworthy\&. In

.IP 
.IP "\fBstrict locking (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a boolean that controls the handling of file locking in the
server\&. When this is set to \f(CW"yes"\fP the server will check every read and
write access for file locks, and deny access if locks exist\&. This can
be slow on some systems\&.
.IP 
When strict locking is \f(CW"no"\fP the server does file lock checks only
when the client explicitly asks for them\&.
.IP 
Well behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it is important,
so in the vast majority of cases \fB"strict locking = no"\fP is
preferable\&.

.IP 
.IP "\fBstrict sync (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Many Windows applications (including the Windows 98 explorer shell)
seem to confuse flushing buffer contents to disk with doing a sync to
disk\&. Under UNIX, a sync call forces the process to be suspended until
the kernel has ensured that all outstanding data in kernel disk
buffers has been safely stored onto stable storage\&. This is very slow
and should only be done rarely\&. Setting this parameter to "no" (the
default) means that smbd ignores the Windows applications requests for
a sync call\&. There is only a possibility of losing data if the
operating system itself that Samba is running on crashes, so there is
little danger in this default setting\&. In addition, this fixes many
performance problems that people have reported with the new Windows98
explorer shell file copies\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"sync always"\fP parameter\&.

\f(CW	strip dot = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	strip dot = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBsync always (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a boolean parameter that controls whether writes will always
be written to stable storage before the write call returns\&. If this is
false then the server will be guided by the client\'s request in each
write call (clients can set a bit indicating that a particular write
should be synchronous)\&. If this is true then every write will be
followed by a fsync() call to ensure the data is written to disk\&.
Note that the \fB"strict sync"\fP parameter must be
set to \f(CW"yes"\fP in order for this parameter to have any affect\&.
.IP

This parameter maps how Samba debug messages are logged onto the
system syslog logging levels\&. Samba debug level zero maps onto syslog
LOG_ERR, debug level one maps onto LOG_WARNING, debug level two maps
onto LOG_NOTICE, debug level three maps onto LOG_INFO\&. All higher 
levels are mapped to LOG_DEBUG\&.
.IP 
This paramter sets the threshold for sending messages to syslog\&. 
Only messages with debug level less than this value will be sent 
to syslog\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	syslog = 1\fP
.IP

.IP "\fBunix password sync (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to synchronize
the UNIX password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB
password in the smbpasswd file is changed\&. If this is set to true the
program specified in the \fB"passwd program"\fP
parameter is called \fI*AS ROOT*\fP - to allow the new UNIX password to be
set without access to the old UNIX password (as the SMB password has
change code has no access to the old password cleartext, only the
new)\&. By default this is set to \f(CW"false"\fP\&.

.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	unix password sync = True\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBunix realname (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter when set causes samba to supply the real name
field from the unix password file to the client\&. This is useful for
setting up mail clients and WWW browsers on systems used by more than
one person\&.

\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	unix realname = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	unix realname = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBupdate encrypted (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter allows a user logging on with a plaintext
password to have their encrypted (hashed) password in the smbpasswd
file to be updated automatically as they log on\&. This option allows a
site to migrate from plaintext password authentication (users
authenticate with plaintext password over the wire, and are checked
against a UNIX account database) to encrypted password authentication
(the SMB challenge/response authentication mechanism) without forcing
all users to re-enter their passwords via smbpasswd at the time the
change is made\&. This is a convenience option to allow the change over
to encrypted passwords to be made over a longer period\&. Once all users
have encrypted representations of their passwords in the smbpasswd
file this parameter should be set to \f(CW"off"\fP\&.
.IP 
In order for this parameter to work correctly the \fB"encrypt
passwords"\fP parameter must be set to \f(CW"no"\fP when
this parameter is set to \f(CW"yes"\fP\&.
.IP 
Note that even when this parameter is set a user authenticating to
smbd must still enter a valid password in order to connect correctly,
and to update their hashed (smbpasswd) passwords\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	update encrypted = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	update encrypted = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBuse rhosts (G)\fP" 
.IP 
If this global parameter is a true, it specifies that the UNIX users
\f(CW"\&.rhosts"\fP file in their home directory will be read to find the
names of hosts and users who will be allowed access without specifying
a password\&.
.IP 
NOTE: The use of \fBuse rhosts\fP can be a major security hole\&. This is
because you are trusting the PC to supply the correct username\&. It is
very easy to get a PC to supply a false username\&. I recommend that the
\fBuse rhosts\fP option be only used if you really know what you are
doing\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	use rhosts = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	use rhosts = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBuser (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"username"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBusers (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"username"\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBusername (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Multiple users may be specified in a comma-delimited list, in which
case the supplied password will be tested against each username in
turn (left to right)\&.
.IP 
The \fBusername=\fP line is needed only when the PC is unable to supply
its own username\&. This is the case for the COREPLUS protocol or where
your users have different WfWg usernames to UNIX usernames\&. In both
these cases you may also be better using the \f(CW\e\eserver\eshare%user\fP
syntax instead\&.
.IP 
The \fBusername=\fP line is not a great solution in many cases as it
means Samba will try to validate the supplied password against each of
the usernames in the username= line in turn\&. This is slow and a bad
idea for lots of users in case of duplicate passwords\&. You may get
timeouts or security breaches using this parameter unwisely\&.
.IP 
Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security\&. This parameter does not
restrict who can login, it just offers hints to the Samba server as to
what usernames might correspond to the supplied password\&. Users can
login as whoever they please and they will be able to do no more
damage than if they started a telnet session\&. The daemon runs as the
user that they log in as, so they cannot do anything that user cannot
do\&.
.IP 
To restrict a service to a particular set of users you can use the
\fB"valid users="\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
If any of the usernames begin with a \f(CW\'@\'\fP then the name will be
looked up first in the yp netgroups list (if Samba is compiled with
netgroup support), followed by a lookup in the UNIX groups database
and will expand to a list of all users in the group of that name\&.
.IP 
If any of the usernames begin with a \f(CW\'+\'\fP then the name will be
looked up only in the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list
of all users in the group of that name\&.
.IP 
If any of the usernames begin with a \f(CW\'&\'\fP then the name will be
looked up only in the yp netgroups database (if Samba is compiled with
netgroup support) and will expand to a list of all users in the
netgroup group of that name\&.
.IP 
Note that searching though a groups database can take quite some time,
and some clients may time out during the search\&.

.IP 
.IP "\fBusername level (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option helps Samba to try and \'guess\' at the real UNIX username,
as many DOS clients send an all-uppercase username\&. By default Samba
tries all lowercase, followed by the username with the first letter
capitalized, and fails if the username is not found on the UNIX
machine\&.
.IP 
If this parameter is set to non-zero the behavior changes\&. This
parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase
combinations to try whilst trying to determine the UNIX user name\&. The
higher the number the more combinations will be tried, but the slower
the discovery of usernames will be\&. Use this parameter when you have
strange usernames on your UNIX machine, such as \f(CW"AstrangeUser"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	username level = 0\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	username level = 5\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBusername map (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of
usernames from the clients to the server\&. This can be used for several
purposes\&. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or
Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses\&. The other is to map
multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share
files\&.
.IP 
The map file is parsed line by line\&. Each line should contain a single
UNIX username on the left then a \f(CW\'=\'\fP followed by a list of
usernames on the right\&. The list of usernames on the right may contain
names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX
username in that group\&. The special client name \f(CW\'*\'\fP is a wildcard
and matches any name\&. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023
characters long\&.
.IP 
The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and
comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the \f(CW\'=\'\fP
signs\&. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand
side then it is replaced with the name on the left\&. Processing then
continues with the next line\&.
.IP 
If any line begins with a \f(CW\'#\'\fP or a \f(CW\';\'\fP then it is ignored
.IP 
If any line begins with an \f(CW\'!\'\fP then the processing will stop after
that line if a mapping was done by the line\&. Otherwise mapping
continues with every line being processed\&. Using \f(CW\'!\'\fP is most
useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file\&.
.IP 
For example to map from the name \f(CW"admin"\fP or \f(CW"administrator"\fP to
the UNIX name \f(CW"root"\fP you would use:
.IP 
\f(CW	root = admin administrator\fP
.IP 
Or to map anyone in the UNIX group \f(CW"system"\fP to the UNIX name
\f(CW"sys"\fP you would use:
.IP 
\f(CW	sys = @system\fP
.IP 
You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file\&.
.IP 
If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup
database is checked before the \f(CW/etc/group\fP database for matching
groups\&.
.IP 
You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double
quotes around the name\&. For example:
.IP 
\f(CW	tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"\fP
.IP 
would map the windows username \f(CW"Andrew Tridgell"\fP to the unix
username tridge\&.
.IP 
The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys,
and map the rest to guest\&. Note the use of the \f(CW\'!\'\fP to tell Samba
to stop processing if it gets a match on that line\&.
.IP 

.DS 
 

	!sys = mary fred
	guest = *

.DE 
 

.IP 
Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of
usernames\&. Thus if you connect to \f(CW"\e\eserver\efred"\fP and \f(CW"fred"\fP
is remapped to \f(CW"mary"\fP then you will actually be connecting to
\f(CW"\e\eserver\emary"\fP and will need to supply a password suitable for
\f(CW"mary"\fP not \f(CW"fred"\fP\&. The only exception to this is the username
passed to the \fB"password server"\fP (if you have
one)\&. The password server will receive whatever username the client
supplies without modification\&.
.IP 
Also note that no reverse mapping is done\&. The main effect this has is
with printing\&. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting
print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don\'t own the
print job\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	no username map\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	username map = /usr/local/samba/lib/users\&.map\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fButmp (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled 
with the option \f(CW--with-utmp\fP\&. If set to True then Samba will attempt
to add utmp or utmpx records (depending on the UNIX system) whenever a
connection is made to a Samba server\&. Sites may use this to record the
user connecting to a Samba share\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"utmp directory"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CWutmp = False\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CWutmp = True\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fButmp consolidate(G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled
with the option \f(CW--with-utmp\fP\&.  Normally each share create a utmp record,
but if there are many connections each with many shares, it can be desirable
to consolidate the shares down to one-per-connection\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CWutmp consolidate = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CWutmp consolidate = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fButmp directory(G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled
with the option \f(CW--with-utmp\fP\&. It specifies a directory pathname that is
used to store the utmp or utmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that
record user connections to a Samba server\&. See also the \fB"utmp"\fP
parameter\&. By default this is not set, meaning the system will use whatever
utmp file the native system is set to use (usually /var/run/utmp on Linux)\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CWno utmp directory\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CWutmp directory = /var/adm/\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fButmp hostname(G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled
with the option \f(CW--with-utmp\fP\&. It specifies the ut_host field of the
utmp and wtmp records\&.  The default is the NetBIOS name (%m), but a very
useful alternative might be the Internet/DNS anme (%M)\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CWutmp hostname = %m\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CWutmp hostname = %M\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBvalid chars (G)\fP" 
.IP 
The option allows you to specify additional characters that should be
considered valid by the server in filenames\&. This is particularly
useful for national character sets, such as adding u-umlaut or a-ring\&.
.IP 
The option takes a list of characters in either integer or character
form with spaces between them\&. If you give two characters with a colon
between them then it will be taken as an lowercase:uppercase pair\&.
.IP 
If you have an editor capable of entering the characters into the
config file then it is probably easiest to use this method\&. Otherwise
you can specify the characters in octal, decimal or hexadecimal form
using the usual C notation\&.
.IP 
For example to add the single character \f(CW\'Z\'\fP to the charset (which
is a pointless thing to do as it\'s already there) you could do one of
the following
.IP 

.DS 
 

	valid chars = Z
	valid chars = z:Z
	valid chars = 0132:0172

.DE 
 

.IP 
The last two examples above actually add two characters, and alter the
uppercase and lowercase mappings appropriately\&.
.IP 
Note that you MUST specify this parameter after the \fB"client
code page"\fP parameter if you have both set\&. If
\fB"client code page"\fP is set after the
\fB"valid chars"\fP parameter the \fB"valid chars"\fP settings will be
overwritten\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"client code page"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP

.DS 
 

	Samba defaults to using a reasonable set of valid characters
	for English systems

.DE 
 

.IP 
\fBExample\fP
\f(CW	valid chars = 0345:0305 0366:0326 0344:0304\fP
.IP 
The above example allows filenames to have the Swedish characters in
them\&.
.IP 
NOTE: It is actually quite difficult to correctly produce a \fB"valid
chars"\fP line for a particular system\&. To automate the process
tino@augsburg\&.net has written a package called \fB"validchars"\fP
which will automatically produce a complete \fB"valid chars"\fP line for
a given client system\&. Look in the examples/validchars/ subdirectory
of your Samba source code distribution for this package\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBvalid users (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of users that should be allowed to login to this
service\&. Names starting with \f(CW\'@\'\fP, \f(CW\'+\'\fP and \f(CW\'&\'\fP are
interpreted using the same rules as described in the \fB"invalid
users"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
If this is empty (the default) then any user can login\&. If a username
is in both this list and the \fB"invalid users"\fP
list then access is denied for that user\&.
.IP 
The current servicename is substituted for
\fB"%S"\fP\&. This is useful in the
\fB[homes]\fP section\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"invalid users"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	No valid users list\&. (anyone can login)\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	valid users = greg, @pcusers\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBveto files(S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor
accessible\&.  Each entry in the list must be separated by a \f(CW\'/\'\fP,
which allows spaces to be included in the entry\&. \f(CW\'*\'\fP and \f(CW\'?\'\fP 
can be used to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS
wildcards\&.
.IP 
Each entry must be a unix path, not a DOS path and must \fI*not*\fP include the 
unix directory separator \f(CW\'/\'\fP\&.
.IP 
Note that the \fB"case sensitive"\fP option is
applicable in vetoing files\&.
.IP 
One feature of the veto files parameter that it is important to be
aware of, is that if a directory contains nothing but files that match
the veto files parameter (which means that Windows/DOS clients cannot
ever see them) is deleted, the veto files within that directory *are
automatically deleted* along with it, if the user has UNIX permissions
to do so\&.
.IP 
Setting this parameter will affect the performance of Samba, as it
will be forced to check all files and directories for a match as they
are scanned\&.
.IP 
See also \fB"hide files"\fP and \fB"case
sensitive"\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	No files or directories are vetoed\&.\fP
.IP 
\fBExamples:\fP
.IP 
Example 1\&.
.IP 

.DS 
 


    Veto any files containing the word Security, 
    any ending in \&.tmp, and any directory containing the
    word root\&.

	veto files = /*Security*/*\&.tmp/*root*/

.DE 
 

.IP 
Example 2\&.
.IP 

.DS 
 

    Veto the Apple specific files that a NetAtalk server
    creates\&.

    veto files = /\&.AppleDouble/\&.bin/\&.AppleDesktop/Network Trash Folder/

.DE 
 

.IP 
.IP "\fBveto oplock files (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is only valid when the \fB"oplocks"\fP
parameter is turned on for a share\&. It allows the Samba administrator
to selectively turn off the granting of oplocks on selected files that
match a wildcarded list, similar to the wildcarded list used in the
\fB"veto files"\fP parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	No files are vetoed for oplock grants\&.\fP
.IP 
\fBExamples:\fP
.IP 
You might want to do this on files that you know will be heavily
contended for by clients\&. A good example of this is in the NetBench
SMB benchmark program, which causes heavy client contention for files
ending in \f(CW"\&.SEM"\fP\&. To cause Samba not to grant oplocks on these
files you would use the line (either in the \fB[global]\fP
section or in the section for the particular NetBench share :
.IP 
\f(CW     veto oplock files = /*\&.SEM/\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBvolume (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This allows you to override the volume label returned for a
share\&. Useful for CDROMs with installation programs that insist on a
particular volume label\&.
.IP 
The default is the name of the share\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBwide links (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter controls whether or not links in the UNIX file system
may be followed by the server\&. Links that point to areas within the
directory tree exported by the server are always allowed; this
parameter controls access only to areas that are outside the directory
tree being exported\&. Note that only links to directories are restricted
by this parameter setting\&. Links directly to files are not disallowed\&.
.IP 
Note that setting this parameter can have a negative effect on your
server performance due to the extra system calls that Samba has to
do in order to perform the link checks\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	wide links = yes\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW 	wide links = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBwins proxy (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a boolean that controls if \fBnmbd\fP will
respond to broadcast name queries on behalf of other hosts\&. You may
need to set this to \f(CW"yes"\fP for some older clients\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	wins proxy = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBwins server (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This specifies the IP address (or DNS name: IP address for preference)
of the WINS server that \fBnmbd\fP should register with\&.
If you have a WINS server on your network then you should set this to
the WINS server\'s IP\&.        
.IP 
You should point this at your WINS server if you have a
multi-subnetted network\&.
.IP 
\fINOTE\fP\&. You need to set up Samba to point to a WINS server if you
have multiple subnets and wish cross-subnet browsing to work correctly\&.
.IP 
See the documentation file BROWSING\&.txt in the docs/ directory of your
Samba source distribution\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	wins server = \fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	wins server = 192\&.9\&.200\&.1\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBwins hook (G)\fP" 
.IP 
When Samba is running as a WINS server this allows you to call an
external program for all changes to the WINS database\&. The primary use
for this option is to allow the dynamic update of external name
resolution databases such as dynamic DNS\&.
.IP 
The wins hook parameter specifies the name of a script or executable
that will be called as follows:
.IP 
wins_hook operation name nametype ttl IP_list
.IP 
The first argument is the operation and is one of "add", "delete",
or "refresh"\&. In most cases the operation can be ignored as the rest
of the parameters provide sufficient information\&. Note that "refresh"
may sometimes be called when the name has not previously been added,
in that case it should be treated as an add\&.
.IP 
The second argument is the netbios name\&. If the name is not a legal
name then the wins hook is not called\&. Legal names contain only
letters, digits, hyphens, underscores and periods\&.
.IP 
The third argument is the netbios name type as a 2 digit hexadecimal
number\&. 
.IP 
The fourth argument is the TTL (time to live) for the name in seconds\&.
.IP 
The fifth and subsequent arguments are the IP addresses currently
registered for that name\&. If this list is empty then the name should
be deleted\&.
.IP 
An example script that calls the BIND dynamic DNS update program
"nsupdate" is provided in the examples directory of the Samba source
code\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fBwins support (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This boolean controls if the \fBnmbd\fP process in
Samba will act as a WINS server\&. You should not set this to true
unless you have a multi-subnetted network and you wish a particular
\fBnmbd\fP to be your WINS server\&. Note that you
should \fI*NEVER*\fP set this to true on more than one machine in your
network\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW	wins support = no\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBworkgroup (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This controls what workgroup your server will appear to be in when
queried by clients\&. Note that this parameter also controls the Domain
name used with the \fB"security=domain"\fP
setting\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	set at compile time to WORKGROUP\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
workgroup = MYGROUP
.IP 
.IP "\fBwritable (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fB"writeable"\fP for people who can\'t spell :-)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBwrite list (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This is a list of users that are given read-write access to a
service\&. If the connecting user is in this list then they will be
given write access, no matter what the \fB"writeable"\fP
option is set to\&. The list can include group names using the @group
syntax\&.
.IP 
Note that if a user is in both the read list and the write list then
they will be given write access\&.
.IP 
See also the \fB"read list"\fP option\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW     write list = <empty string>\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	write list = admin, root, @staff\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBwrite cache size (S)\fP" 
.IP 
This integer parameter (new with Samba 2\&.0\&.7) if set to non-zero causes Samba to create an in-memory
cache for each oplocked file (it does \fBnot\fP do this for non-oplocked files)\&. All
writes that the client does not request to be flushed directly to disk will be
stored in this cache if possible\&. The cache is flushed onto disk when a write
comes in whose offset would not fit into the cache or when the file is closed
by the client\&. Reads for the file are also served from this cache if the data
is stored within it\&.
.IP 
This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write
size for RAID disks (ie\&. writes may be tuned to be the RAID stripe size) and
can improve performance on systems where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck
but there is free memory for userspace programs\&.
.IP 
The integer parameter specifies the size of this cache (per oplocked file)
in bytes\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW     write cache size = 0\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CW	     write cache size = 262144\fP
for a 256k cache size per file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBwrite ok (S)\fP" 
.IP 
Synonym for \fBwriteable\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBwrite raw (G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter controls whether or not the server will support raw
writes SMB\'s when transferring data from clients\&. You should never
need to change this parameter\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	write raw = yes\fP
.IP 
.IP "\fBwriteable\fP" 
.IP 
An inverted synonym is \fB"read only"\fP\&.
.IP 
If this parameter is \f(CW"no"\fP, then users of a service may not create
or modify files in the service\'s directory\&.
.IP 
Note that a printable service \fB("printable = yes")\fP
will \fI*ALWAYS*\fP allow writing to the directory (user privileges
permitting), but only via spooling operations\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CW 	writeable = no\fP
.IP 
\fBExamples:\fP

.DS 
 

 	read only = no
 	writeable = yes
 	write ok = yes

.DE 
 

.IP 
.IP "\fBwtmp directory(G)\fP" 
.IP 
This parameter is only available if Samba has been configured and compiled
with the option \f(CW--with-utmp\fP\&. It specifies a directory pathname that is
used to store the wtmp or wtmpx files (depending on the UNIX system) that
record user connections to a Samba server\&. See also the
\fB"utmp directory"\fP parameter\&. By default this is
not set, meaning the system will use either what has been set by
\fB"utmp"\fP or whatever wtmp file the native system is set to use
(usually /var/run/wtmp on Linux)\&.
.IP 
\fBDefault:\fP
\f(CWno wtmp directory\fP
.IP 
\fBExample:\fP
\f(CWwtmp directory = /var/adm/\fP
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "WARNINGS" 
.PP 
Although the configuration file permits service names to contain
spaces, your client software may not\&. Spaces will be ignored in
comparisons anyway, so it shouldn\'t be a problem - but be aware of the
possibility\&.
.PP 
On a similar note, many clients - especially DOS clients - limit
service names to eight characters\&. \fBSmbd\fP has no
such limitation, but attempts to connect from such clients will fail
if they truncate the service names\&.  For this reason you should
probably keep your service names down to eight characters in length\&.
.PP 
Use of the \fB[homes]\fP and \fB[printers]\fP
special sections make life for an administrator easy, but the various
combinations of default attributes can be tricky\&. Take extreme care
when designing these sections\&. In particular, ensure that the
permissions on spool directories are correct\&.
