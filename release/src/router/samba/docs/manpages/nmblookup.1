nmblookup \- NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS names
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBnmblookup\fP [-M] [-R] [-S] [-r] [-A] [-h] [-B broadcast address] [-U unicast address] [-d debuglevel] [-s smb config file] [-i NetBIOS scope] [-T] name
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This program is part of the \fBSamba\fP suite\&.
.PP 
\fBnmblookup\fP is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP
addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries\&. The options
allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area
or to a particular machine\&. All queries are done over UDP\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fB-M\fP" 
Searches for a master browser by looking up the 
NetBIOS name \fBname\fP with a type of 0x1d\&. If \fBname\fP
is \f(CW"-"\fP then it does a lookup on the special name \f(CW__MSBROWSE__\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-R\fP" 
Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a
recursive lookup\&. This is used when sending a name query to a machine
running a WINS server and the user wishes to query the names in the
WINS server\&.  If this bit is unset the normal (broadcast responding)
NetBIOS processing code on a machine is used instead\&. See rfc1001,
rfc1002 for details\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-S\fP" 
Once the name query has returned an IP address then do a
node status query as well\&. A node status query returns the NetBIOS names 
registered by a host\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-r\fP" 
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP
datagrams\&. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 where it
ignores the source port of the requesting packet and only replies to
UDP port 137\&. Unfortunately, on most UNIX systems root privilage is
needed to bind to this port, and in addition, if the
\fBnmbd\fP daemon is running on this machine it also
binds to this port\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-A\fP" 
Interpret <name> as an IP Address and do a node status
query on this address\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-h\fP" 
Print a help (usage) message\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-B broadcast address\fP" 
Send the query to the given broadcast
address\&. Without this option the default behavior of nmblookup is to
send the query to the broadcast address of the network
interfaces as either auto-detected or defined in the 
\fBinterfaces\fP parameter of the 
\fBsmb\&.conf (5)\fP file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-U unicast address\fP" 
Do a unicast query to the specified
address or host \f(CW"unicast address"\fP\&. This option (along with the
\fB-R\fP option) is needed to query a WINS server\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-d debuglevel\fP" 
debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10\&.
.IP 
The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.
.IP 
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged about the
activities of \fBnmblookup\fP\&. At level 0, only critical errors and
serious warnings will be logged\&.
.IP 
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are
designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of
data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.
.IP 
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the \fBlog
level\fP parameter in the \fBsmb\&.conf
(5)\fP file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-s smb\&.conf\fP" 
This parameter specifies the pathname to the
Samba configuration file, \fBsmb\&.conf\fP\&. 
This file controls all aspects of
the Samba setup on the machine\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-i scope\fP" 
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that \fBnmblookup\fP will use
to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names\&. For details on the
use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001\&.txt and rfc1002\&.txt\&. NetBIOS scopes
are \fIvery\fP rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the
system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
communicate with\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-T\fP" 
This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to be
looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a DNS name, and printed out
before each \f(CW"IP address   NetBIOS name"\fP pair that is the normal
output\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBname\fP" 
This is the NetBIOS name being queried\&. Depending upon
the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP address\&. If a
NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified by
appending \f(CW#<type>\fP to the name\&. This name may also be \f(CW"*"\fP,
which will return all registered names within a broadcast area\&.
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "EXAMPLES" 
.PP 
\fBnmblookup\fP can be used to query a WINS server (in the same way
\fBnslookup\fP is used to query DNS servers)\&. To query a WINS server,
\fBnmblookup\fP must be called like this:
.PP 
\f(CWnmblookup -U server -R \'name\'\fP
.PP 
For example, running :
.PP 
\f(CWnmblookup -U samba\&.org -R IRIX#1B\'\fP
.PP 
would query the WINS server samba\&.org for the domain master
browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup\&.

.SH "VERSION" 
.PP 
This man page is correct for version 2\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.

.SH "AUTHOR" 
.PP 
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell samba@samba\&.org\&. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP 
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
\fBftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/\fP)
and updated for the Samba2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&.
samba@samba\&.org\&.
