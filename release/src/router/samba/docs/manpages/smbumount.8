.TH SMBUMOUNT 8 "23 Jun 2001" "smbumount 2.0.10"
.SH NAME
smbumount \- umount for normal users
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smbumount
.B mount-point

.SH DESCRIPTION
With this program, normal users can unmount smb-filesystems, provided
that it is suid root.

.B smbumount
has been written to give normal linux-users more control over their
resources. It is safe to install this program suid root, because only
the user who has mounted a filesystem is allowed to unmount it again.

For root it is not necessary to use smbumount. The normal umount
program works perfectly well, but it would certainly be problematic to
make umount setuid root.

.SH OPTIONS
.B mount-point
.RS 3
.B mount-point
is the directory you want to unmount.
