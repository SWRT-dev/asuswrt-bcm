.PP 
.SH "NAME" 
swat \- Samba Web Administration Tool
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBswat\fP [-s smb config file] [-a]
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This program is part of the \fBSamba\fP suite\&.
.PP 
\fBswat\fP allows a Samba administrator to configure the complex
\fBsmb\&.conf\fP file via a Web browser\&. In
addition, a swat configuration page has help links to all the
configurable options in the \fBsmb\&.conf\fP file
allowing an administrator to easily look up the effects of any change\&.
.PP 
\fBswat\fP is run from \fBinetd\fP
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fB-s smb configuration file\fP" 
The default configuration file path is
determined at compile time\&.
.IP 
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the
\fBsmbd\fP server\&. This is the file that \fBswat\fP will
modify\&. The information in this file includes server-specific
information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions
of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See smb\&.conf
(5) for more information\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-a\fP" 
.IP 
This option disables authentication and puts \fBswat\fP in demo mode\&. In
that mode anyone will be able to modify the
\fBsmb\&.conf\fP file\&.
.IP 
Do NOT enable this option on a production server\&.
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "INSTALLATION" 
.PP 
After you compile SWAT you need to run \f(CW"make install"\fP to install the
swat binary and the various help files and images\&. A default install
would put these in:
.PP 

.DS 
 

/usr/local/samba/bin/swat
/usr/local/samba/swat/images/*
/usr/local/samba/swat/help/*

.DE 
 

.PP 
.SH "INETD INSTALLATION" 
.PP 
You need to edit your \f(CW/etc/inetd\&.conf\fP and \f(CW/etc/services\fP to
enable \fBSWAT\fP to be launched via inetd\&. 
.PP 
In \f(CW/etc/services\fP you need to add a line like this:
.PP 
\f(CWswat            901/tcp\fP
.PP 
Note for NIS/YP users - you may need to rebuild the NIS service maps
rather than alter your local \f(CW/etc/services\fP file\&.
.PP 
the choice of port number isn\'t really important except that it should
be less than 1024 and not currently used (using a number above 1024
presents an obscure security hole depending on the implementation
details of your \fBinetd\fP daemon)\&.
.PP 
In \f(CW/etc/inetd\&.conf\fP you should add a line like this:
.PP 
\f(CWswat    stream  tcp     nowait\&.400  root    /usr/local/samba/bin/swat swat\fP
.PP 
One you have edited \f(CW/etc/services\fP and \f(CW/etc/inetd\&.conf\fP you need
to send a HUP signal to inetd\&. To do this use \f(CW"kill -1 PID"\fP where
PID is the process ID of the inetd daemon\&.
.PP 
.SH "LAUNCHING" 
.PP 
To launch \fBswat\fP just run your favorite web browser and point it at
\f(CWhttp://localhost:901/\fP\&.
.PP 
\fBNote that you can attach to \fBswat\fP from any IP connected machine but
connecting from a remote machine leaves your connection open to
password sniffing as passwords will be sent in the clear over the
wire\&.\fP
.PP 
.SH "FILES" 
.PP 
\fB/etc/inetd\&.conf\fP
.PP 
This file must contain suitable startup information for the
meta-daemon\&. 
.PP 
\fB/etc/services\fP
.PP 
This file must contain a mapping of service name (e\&.g\&., swat) to
service port (e\&.g\&., 901) and protocol type (e\&.g\&., tcp)\&. 
.PP 
\fB/usr/local/samba/lib/smb\&.conf\fP
.PP 
This is the default location of the \fIsmb\&.conf\fP server configuration
file that \fBswat\fP edits\&. Other common places that systems install
this file are \fI/usr/samba/lib/smb\&.conf\fP and \fI/etc/smb\&.conf\fP\&.
.PP 
This file describes all the services the server is to make available
to clients\&. See \fBsmb\&.conf (5)\fP for more information\&.
.PP 
.SH "WARNINGS" 
.PP 
\fBswat\fP will rewrite your \fBsmb\&.conf\fP file\&. It
will rearrange the entries and delete all comments,
\fB"include="\fP and
\fB"copy="\fP options\&. If you have a
carefully crafted \fBsmb\&.conf\fP then back it up
or don\'t use \fBswat\fP!
.PP 
.SH "VERSION" 
.PP 
This man page is correct for version 2\&.0 of the Samba suite\&.
.PP 
.SH "SEE ALSO" 
.PP 
\fBinetd (8)\fP, \fBnmbd (8)\fP,
\fBsmb\&.conf (5)\fP\&.
.PP 
.SH "AUTHOR" 
.PP 
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell (samba@samba\&.org)\&. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed\&.
.PP 
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\&. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
\fBftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/\fP)
and updated for the Samba2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&.
samba@samba\&.org\&.
