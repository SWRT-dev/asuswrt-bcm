Subject: Using a Samba share as an administrative share for MS Office, etc.
==============================================================================

Problem:
========
Microsoft Office products can be installed as an administrative installation
from which the application can either be run off the administratively installed
product that resides on a shared resource, or from which that product can be
installed onto workstation clients.

The general mechanism for implementing an adminstrative installation involves
running:
	X:\setup /A, where X is the drive letter of either CDROM or floppy

This installation process will NOT install the product for use per se, but
rather results in unpacking of the compressed distribution files into a target
shared folder. For this process you need write privilidge to the share and it
is desirable to enable file locking and share mode operation during this
process.

Subsequent installation of MS Office from this share will FAIL unless certain
precautions are taken. This failure will be caused by share mode operation
which will prevent the MS Office installation process from re-opening various
dynamic link library files and will cause sporadic file not found problems.

Solution:
=========
1. As soon as the administrative installation (unpacking) has completed
	set the following parameters on the share containing it:
	[MSOP95]
		path = /where_you_put_it
		comment = Your comment
		volume = "The_CD_ROM_Label"
		read only = yes
		available = yes
		share modes = no
		locking = no
		browseable = yes
		public = yes

2. Now you are ready to run the setup program from the Microsoft Windows
workstation as follows:-
	\\"Server_Name"\MSOP95\msoffice\setup

MS Office Sharing - Please note:
================================

Workgroup Templates should be stored on an ordinary writable or read-only share
but USER templates MUST be stored on a writable share _OR_ on the users' local
machine.
