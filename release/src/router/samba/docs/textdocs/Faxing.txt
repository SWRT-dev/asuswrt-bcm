This text describes how to turn your SAMBA-server into a fax-server
for any environment, especially for Windows.
   Author: Gerhard Zuber <zuber@berlin.snafu.de>
   Version: 1.4
   Date: 04. Aug. 1997

Requirements:
   UNIX box (Linux preferred) with SAMBA and a faxmodem
   ghostscript package
   mgetty+sendfax package
   pbm package (portable bitmap tools)

FTP sites:

   tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/sources/sbin/mgetty+sendfax

                 or ???   pbm10dec91.tgz pbmplus10dec91.tgz


making mgetty+sendfax running:
==============================

   go to source tree: /usr/src/mgetty+sendfax
   cp policy.h-dist policy.h

   change your settings: valid tty ports, modem initstring, Station-Id

#define MODEM_INIT_STRING       "AT &F S0=0 &D3 &K3 &C1\\\\N2"

#define FAX_STATION_ID  "49 30 12345678"

#define FAX_MODEM_TTYS  "ttyS1:ttyS2:ttyS3"

   Modem initstring is for rockwell based modems
   if you want to use mgetty+sendfax as PPP-dialin-server,
   define AUTO_PPP in Makefile:

CFLAGS=-O2 -Wall -pipe -DAUTO_PPP

   compile it and install the package.
   edit your /etc/inittab and let mgetty running on your preferred
   ports:

s3:45:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyS2 vt100

   now issue a
      kill -HUP 1
   and enjoy with the lightning LEDs on your modem
   your now are ready to receive faxes !


   if you want a PPP dialin-server, edit 
      /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config

/AutoPPP/ -     ppp     /usr/sbin/pppd auth debug passive modem 


   Note: this package automatically decides between a fax call and
         a modem call. In case of modem call you get a login prompt !

Tools for printing faxes:
=========================

   your incomed faxes are in:
    /var/spool/fax/incoming

   print it with:

     for i in *
     do
     g3cat $i | g3tolj | lpr -P hp
     done

   in case of low resolution use instead:

     g3cat $i | g3tolj -aspect 2 | lpr -P hp


   g3cat is in the tools-section, g3tolj is in the contrib-section
   for printing to HP lasers.

   If you want to produce files for displaying and printing with Windows, use
   some tools from the pbm-package like follow

     g3cat $i | g3topbm - |  ppmtopcx - >$i.pcx  

   and view it with your favourite Windows tool (maybe paintbrush)


Now making the fax-server:
===========================

    fetch the file
       mgetty+sendfax/frontends/winword/faxfilter

    and place it in

      /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/

    prepare your faxspool file as mentioned in this file
    edit fax/faxspool.in and reinstall or change the final
    /usr/local/bin/faxspool too.

            if [ "$user" = "root" -o "$user" = "fax" -o \
                 "$user" = "lp" -o "$user" = "daemon" -o "$user" = "bin" ]

    find the first line and change the second.

    make sure you have pbmtext (from the pbm-package). This is
    needed for creating the small header line on each page.
    Notes on pbmplus:
    Some peoples had problems with precompiled binaries (especially
    at linux) with a shared lib libgr.so.x.x. The better way is
    to fetch the source and compile it. One needs only pbmtext for
    generating the small line on top of each page /faxheader). Install
    only the individual programs you need. If you install the full
    package then install pbmplus first and then mgetty+sendfax, because
    this package has some changed programs by itself (but not pbmtext).

    make sure your ghostscript is functional. You need fonts !
    I prefer these from the OS/2 disks

    prepare your faxheader
      /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxheader

    edit your /etc/printcap file:

# FAX 
lp3|fax:\
        :lp=/dev/null:\
        :sd=/usr/spool/lp3:\
        :if=/usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxfilter:sh:sf:mx#0:\
        :lf=/usr/spool/lp3/fax-log:




    edit your /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf

    so you have a smb based printer named "fax"


The final step:
===============

    Now you have a printer called "fax" which can be used via
    TCP/IP-printing (lpd-system) or via SAMBA (windows printing).

    On every system you are able to produce postscript-files you
    are ready to fax.

    On Windows 3.1 95 and NT:

    Install a printer wich produces postscript output,
       e.g.  apple laserwriter

    connect the "fax" to your printer 


    Now write your first fax. Use your favourite wordprocessor,
    write, winword, notepad or whatever you want, and start
    with the headerpage.

    Usually each fax has a header page. It carries your name,
    your address, your phone/fax-number.

    It carries also the recipient, his address and his *** fax
    number ***. Now here is the trick:

    Use the text:
       Fax-Nr: 123456789
    as the recipients fax-number. Make sure this text does not
    occur in regular text ! Make sure this text is not broken
    by formatting information, e.g. format it as a single entity.
    (Windows Write and Win95 Wordpad are functional, maybe newer
    versions of Winword are breaking formatting information).

    The trick is that postscript output is human readable and
    the faxfilter program scans the text for this pattern and
    uses the found number as the fax-destination-number.

    Now print your fax through the fax-printer and it will be
    queued for later transmission. Use faxrunq for sending the
    queue out.

    Notes of SAMBA smb.conf:
    Simply use fall through from the samba printer to the unix
    printer. Sample:


 printcap name = /etc/printcap
 print command = /usr/bin/lpr -r -P %p %s
 lpq command = /usr/bin/lpq -P %p
 lprm command = /usr/bin/lprm -P %p %j


[fax]
    comment = FAX (mgetty+sendfax)
    path = /tmp
    printable = yes
    public = yes
    create mode = 0700
    browseable = yes
    guest ok = no
