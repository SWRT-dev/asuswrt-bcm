> Are there any Macintosh clients for Samba?

Yes. Thursby now have a CIFS Client / Server called DAVE - see
http://www.thursby.com/

They test it against Windows 95, Windows NT and samba for
compatibility issues.  At the time of writing, DAVE was at version
1.0.1. The 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 update is available as a free download from
the Thursby web site (the speed of finder copies has been greatly
enhanced, and there are bug-fixes included).

Alternatives - There are two free implementations of AppleTalk for
several kinds of UNIX machnes, and several more commercial ones.
These products allow you to run file services and print services
natively to Macintosh users, with no additional support required on
the Macintosh.  The two free omplementations are Netatalk,
http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk/, and CAP,
http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/appletalk/atalk.html.  What Samba offers MS
Windows users, these packages offer to Macs.  For more info on these
packages, Samba, and Linux (and other UNIX-based systems) see
