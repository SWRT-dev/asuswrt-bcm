==========================================================================
	Supporting the famous PRINTER$ share

Disclaimer:

	This ONLY works with Windows 95
	It does NOT work with Windows NT 4


Goal:

	When you click on a samba shared printer, you can now install the driver
	automatically onto the Windows 95 machine, as you would from an NT server.
	
How To:

	It's a three step config.
	
	First, create a new directory, where you will put the driver files, and
	make a share in smb.conf pointing to it.

	Example:
	
		[printer$]
   		  path=/usr/local/samba/printer
   		  public=yes
   		  browseable=yes

	Second, you have to build the list of drivers required for a specific
	printer. This is the most complicated thing to do. Get the files
	'msprint.inf' and 'msprint2.inf' from Windows 95, the easiest way is to
	grab them from a working Windows 95 computer. They are usually located
	in 'c:\windows\inf'. Look in them for the printer you have. Run the new
	program 'make_printerdef' with the file name and the printer name as
	parameters. If you have drivers for an unsupported or updated printer,
	first install these drivers on an Windows 95 system. There will be a
	file created in your inf directory named 'oem?.inf' (where the ? is some
	number). Use this file instead of msprint.inf.

	Example: (from the /usr/local/samba/lib directory)
		
	make_printerdef msprint.inf "Apple LaserWriter" >> printers.def
	 
	The program will print out a list of required files to stderr.
	Copy all the files listed into the directory you created in step 1.
	If you have "preserve case = yes" make sure your files names match
	EXACTLY the names listed.
	
	Third, you need to add 2 new parameters in smb.conf. One is in the
	[global] section, called 'printer driver file' pointing to the printer
	description file you just created, and the other in each printer share,
	called 'printer driver location' pointing to where the client will get 
	the drivers. Don't forget to set correctly the printer driver parameter
	to the Windows printer name.

	Example:
	
		[global]
  		  printer driver file=/usr/local/samba/lib/printers.def

		[lp]
		   comment = My old printer laser
		   browseable = yes
		   printable = yes
		   public = yes
		   create mode = 0700
		   printer driver=Apple LaserWriter
		   printer driver location=\\%h\PRINTER$

	%h will expand to the computer name, and PRINTER$ is the name of the
	share created in step one.
	
	
If it doesn't work for you, don't send flame ! It worked for me. In case of
trouble don't hesitate to send me a mail with your smb.conf file and 
printers.def

For those of you who like to know the details, and in case I have guessed
wrong on some of the fields - The following is the format of the entries 
in the printers.def file: (entries are 1 single line - they are split here 
for readability)

<Long Printer Name>:<Driver File Name>:<Data File Name>:<Help File Name>:
<Language Monitor Name>:<Default Data Type>:<Comma Separated list of Files>

The <Help File Name> and the <Language Monitor Name> can be empty.
If no <Driver File Name> or <Data File Name> are specified in the inf file,
these will default to the section name for the printer.

The following is an excerpt from the MSPRINT2.INF file on a WIN95 machine.
I have deleted all but the entries relating to installing a driver for the
"QMS ColorScript 100 Model 30" printer. Using this "file" I'll try to 
explain how the printers.def file is created.

make_printerdef is run with the first argument being the name of this
file (MSPRINT2.INF in this case) and the second argument being the
name of the printer ("QMS ColorScript 100 Model 30" in this case).

The printer name is first found in the "Model section" to obtain the
name of the "Installer Section" (this is the name after the equal sign).
We ignore the alternate name.

The "Installer Section" contains entries for "CopyFiles" and "DataSection".
The "CopyFiles" line gives a list of all the required files for this
printer. If the name begins with an @ it is the name of a file (after
you strip off the @), otherwise it is the name of a "Copy Section" which
in turn is a list of files required. This printer has one file listed
"QCS30503.SPD" and two sections "COLOR_QMS_100_30" and "PSCRIPT". The
"COLOR_QMS_100_30" section is listed in the "[DestinationDirs]" as 
having a value of 23. This means that all files listed in this section
should go into the "color" subdirectory. The list of files to copy for
this printer is thus:

QCS30503.SPD,color\QMS10030.ICM,PSCRIPT.DRV,PSCRIPT.HLP,PSCRIPT.INI,
TESTPS.TXT,APPLE380.SPD,FONTS.MFM,ICONLIB.DLL,PSMON.DLL

From the "Data Section" we obtain values for "DriverFile", "HelpFile",
and "LanguageMonitor". The % around the value for "LanguageMonitor"
indicates that it is a string that can be localized so its actual value
is obtained from the "[Strings]" section. The "Data Section" could also
have contained an entry for "DefaultDataType".

Using the information we have obtained we can now construct the entry
for the printers.def file.

<Long Printer Name>     -> QMS ColorScript 100 Model 30  (name given
				on the command line)
<Driver File Name>      -> PSCRIPT.DRV  (given in Data Section)
<Data File Name>        -> QCS30503.SPD (defaults to Install Section name)
<Help File Name>        -> PSCRIPT.HLP  (given in Data Section)
<Language Monitor Name> -> PostScript Language Monitor  (given in Data Section)
<Default Data Type>     -> RAW (default if not specified)


So.... the enty (actually one line but split here for readability) would
be:

QMS ColorScript 100 Model 30:PSCRIPT.DRV:QCS30503.SPD:
PSCRIPT.HLP:PostScript Language Monitor:RAW:
QCS30503.SPD,color\QMS10030.ICM,PSCRIPT.DRV,PSCRIPT.HLP,PSCRIPT.INI,
TESTPS.TXT,APPLE380.SPD,FONTS.MFM,ICONLIB.DLL,PSMON.DLL
