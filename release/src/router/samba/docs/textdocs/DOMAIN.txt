Subject:	Network Logons and Roaming (Roving) Profiles
===========================================================================
NOTE! This document has undergone a major update to correct errors and add
significant new material. Much of the material is based on what went into the
book Special Edition, Using Samba. (Richard Sharpe)

A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server (NT server and 
other systems based on NT server support this, as does at least Samba TNG now).

The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is
identical and is explained in BROWSING.txt. It should be noted, that browsing
is total orthogonal to logon support.

Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
document.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X clients.

Work is underway to support domain logon for MS Windows NT clients - this
is mostly working and is more fully implemented in the Samba TNG stream. It 
should be included in Samba 3.0 when that is finally released.

Support is also not complete.  Samba does not yet support the sharing
of the Windows NT-style SAM database with other systems.  However this is
only one way of having a shared user database: exactly the same effect can
be achieved by having all servers in a domain share a distributed NIS or
Kerberos authentication database.

When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, ie they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.

Another thing commonly associated with single-logon domains is remote
administration over the SMB protocol.  Again, there is no reason why this
cannot be implemented with an underlying username database which is
different from the Windows NT SAM.  Support for the Remote Administration
Protocol is planned for a future release of Samba.

Network logon support as discussed in this document is aimed at Window for
Workgroups, and Windows 9X clients. Logon support for Windows NT clients is
part of the domain controller functionality that is partially implemented in 
the Samba 2.0.x streams and is more fully implemented in Samba TNG.

Support for profiles is confirmed as working for Win95, NT 4.0 and NT 3.51.
It is possible to specify: the profile location; script file to be loaded
on login; the user's home directory; and for NT a kick-off time could also
now easily be supported. However, there are some differences between Win9X
profile support and WinNT profile support. These are discussed below.

With NT Workstations, all this does not require the use or intervention of
an NT 4.0 or NT 3.51 server: Samba can now replace the logon services
provided by an NT server, to a limited and experimental degree (for example,
running "User Manager for Domains" will not provide you with access to
a domain created by a Samba Server).

With Win95, the help of an NT server can be enlisted, both for profile storage
and for user authentication.  For details on user authentication, see
security_level.txt.  For details on profile storage, see below.

Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.

Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is worthwhile looking
at how a Win9X client performs a logon:

1. The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
   a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS address DOMAIN<00> at the
   NetBIOS layer.  The client chooses the first response it receives, which
   contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
   \\SERVER.

2. The client then connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
   then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).

3. The client then does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
   of the user's logon script. 

4. The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for this script
   and if it is found and can be read, is retrieved and executed by the client.
   After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.

5. The client then sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server, to retrieve
   the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
   response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more than
   the user's home share, profiles for Win9X clients MUST reside in the user
   home directory.

6. The client then connects to the user's home share and searches for the 
   user's profile. As it turns out, you can specify the users home share as
   a sharename and path. For example, \\server\fred\.profile.

   If the profiles are found, they are implemented.

7. The client then disconnects from the user's home share, and reconnects to
   the NetLogon share and looks for CONFIG.POL, the policies file. If this is
   found, it is read and implemented.


Configuration Instructions:	Network Logons
==============================================

NOTE. Contrary to what earlier versions of this file said, you DO NOT NEED
TO SET UP SAMBA AS A DOMAIN MASTER BROWSER OR A LOCAL MASTER BROWSER. However
you might need to do this for other reasons.

To use domain logons and profiles you need to do the following:

1) Create a share called [netlogon] in your smb.conf. This share should
   be readable by all users, and probably should not be writeable. This
   share will hold your network logon scripts, and the CONFIG.POL file
   (Note: for details on the CONFIG.POL file, how to use it, what it is,
   refer to the Microsoft Windows NT Administration documentation.
   The format of these files is not known, so you will need to use
   Microsoft tools).

For example I have used:

   [netlogon]
    path = /data/dos/netlogon
    writeable = no
    guest ok = no

   Note that it is important that this share is not writeable by ordinary
   users, in a secure environment: ordinary users should not be allowed
   to modify or add files that another user's computer would then download
   when they log in.

2) in the [global] section of smb.conf set the following:

   domain logons = yes
   logon script = %U.bat

   The choice of batch file is, of course, up to you. The above would
   give each user a separate batch file as the %U will be changed to
   their username automatically. The other standard % macros may also be
   used. You can make the batch files come from a subdirectory by using
   something like:

   logon script = scripts\%U.bat

3) create the batch files to be run when the user logs in. If the batch
   file doesn't exist then no batch file will be run. 

   In the batch files you need to be careful to use DOS style cr/lf line
   endings. If you don't then DOS may get confused. I suggest you use a
   DOS editor to remotely edit the files if you don't know how to produce
   DOS style files under unix.

4) Use smbclient with the -U option for some users to make sure that
   the \\server\NETLOGON share is available, the batch files are
   visible and they are readable by the users.

5) you will probabaly find that your clients automatically mount the
   \\SERVER\NETLOGON share as drive z: while logging in. You can put
   some useful programs there to execute from the batch files.

NOTE: You must be using "security = user" or "security = server" or 
"security = domain" for domain logons to work correctly.  Share level 
security won't work correctly.

NOTE! If your logon server is in another subnet, or any of the servers that
your clients need to access are in other subnets, YOU WILL NEED TO CONFIGURE
A WINS SERVER IN YOUR NETWORK!


Configuration Instructions:	Setting up Roaming User Profiles
================================================================

NOTE! There has been considerable confusion around roaming profiles from
about Samba 2.0.4 to 2.0.5. The support changed in Samba 2.0.6, and, as the
Samba team now understands how roaming profiles work for both NT and Win9X
clients, the functionality will not be changed again.

NOTE! Roaming profiles support is different for Win9X and WinNT.

Before discussing how to configure roaming profiles, it is useful to see how
Win9X and WinNT clients implement these features.

Win9X clients send a NetUserGetInfo request to the server to get the user's
profiles location. However, the response does not have room for a separate 
profiles location field, only the users home share. This means that Win9X 
profiles are restricted to being in the user's home directory.

WinNT clients send a NetSAMLogon RPC request, which contains many fields, 
including a separate field for the location of the user's profiles. 

This means that support for profiles is different for Win9X and WinNT.

Windows NT Configuration
------------------------

To support WinNT clients, inn the [global] section of smb.conf set the
following (for example):

  logon path = \\profileserver\profileshare\profilepath\%U\moreprofilepath

The default for this option is \\%N\%U\profile, namely
\\sambaserver\username\profile.  The \\N%\%U service is created
automatically by the [homes] service.

If you are using a samba server for the profiles, you _must_ make the
share specified in the logon path browseable. 

[lkcl 26aug96 - we have discovered a problem where Windows clients can
maintain a connection to the [homes] share in between logins.  The
[homes] share must NOT therefore be used in a profile path.]

Windows 9X Configuration
------------------------

To support Win9X clients, you must use the "logon home" parameter. Samba has
now been fixed so that "net use/home" now works as well, and it, too, relies
on the "logon home" parameter.

By using the logon home parameter, you are restricted to putting Win9X 
profiles in the user's home directory.

But wait! There is a trick you can use. If you set the following in the
[global] section of your smb.conf file:

  logon home = \\%L\%U\.profiles

then your Win9X clients will dutifully put their clients in a subdirectory
of your home directory called .profiles (thus making them hidden).

Not only that, but 'net use/home' will also work, because of a feature in 
Win9X. It removes any directory stuff off the end of the home directory area
and only uses the server and share portion. That is, it looks like you
specified \\%L\%U for "logon home".

Win9X and WinNT Configuration
-----------------------------

You can support profiles for both Win9X and WinNT clients by setting both the
"logon home" and "logon path" parameters. For example:

  logon home = \\%L\%U\.profiles
  logon path = \\%L\profiles\%U

NOTE! I have not checked what 'net use /home' does on NT when "logon home" is
set as above.

Windows 9X Profile Setup
------------------------
When a user first logs in on Windows 9X, the file user.DAT is created,
as are folders "Start Menu", "Desktop", "Programs" and "Nethood".  
These directories and their contents will be merged with the local
versions stored in c:\windows\profiles\username on subsequent logins,
taking the most recent from each.  You will need to use the [global]
options "preserve case = yes", "short case preserve = yes" and
"case sensitive = no" in order to maintain capital letters in shortcuts
in any of the profile folders.

The user.DAT file contains all the user's preferences.  If you wish to
enforce a set of preferences, rename their user.DAT file to user.MAN,
and deny them write access to this file.

1) On the Windows 95 machine, go to Control Panel | Passwords and
   select the User Profiles tab.  Select the required level of
   roaming preferences.  Press OK, but do _not_ allow the computer
   to reboot.

2) On the Windows 95 machine, go to Control Panel | Network |
   Client for Microsoft Networks | Preferences.  Select 'Log on to
   NT Domain'.  Then, ensure that the Primary Logon is 'Client for
   Microsoft Networks'.  Press OK, and this time allow the computer
   to reboot.

Under Windows 95, Profiles are downloaded from the Primary Logon.
If you have the Primary Logon as 'Client for Novell Networks', then
the profiles and logon script will be downloaded from your Novell
Server.  If you have the Primary Logon as 'Windows Logon', then the
profiles will be loaded from the local machine - a bit against the
concept of roaming profiles, if you ask me.

You will now find that the Microsoft Networks Login box contains
[user, password, domain] instead of just [user, password].  Type in
the samba server's domain name (or any other domain known to exist,
but bear in mind that the user will be authenticated against this
domain and profiles downloaded from it, if that domain logon server
supports it), user name and user's password.

Once the user has been successfully validated, the Windows 95 machine
will inform you that 'The user has not logged on before' and asks you
if you wish to save the user's preferences?  Select 'yes'.

Once the Windows 95 client comes up with the desktop, you should be able
to examine the contents of the directory specified in the "logon path"
on the samba server and verify that the "Desktop", "Start Menu",
"Programs" and "Nethood" folders have been created.

These folders will be cached locally on the client, and updated when
the user logs off (if you haven't made them read-only by then :-).
You will find that if the user creates further folders or short-cuts,
that the client will merge the profile contents downloaded with the
contents of the profile directory already on the local client, taking
the newest folders and short-cuts from each set.

If you have made the folders / files read-only on the samba server,
then you will get errors from the w95 machine on logon and logout, as
it attempts to merge the local and the remote profile.  Basically, if
you have any errors reported by the w95 machine, check the unix file
permissions and ownership rights on the profile directory contents,
on the samba server.


If you have problems creating user profiles, you can reset the user's
local desktop cache, as shown below.  When this user then next logs in,
they will be told that they are logging in "for the first time".


1) instead of logging in under the [user, password, domain] dialog,
   press escape.

2) run the regedit.exe program, and look in:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Windows\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

   you will find an entry, for each user, of ProfilePath.  Note the
   contents of this key (likely to be c:\windows\profiles\username),
   then delete the key ProfilePath for the required user.

   [Exit the registry editor].

3) WARNING - before deleting the contents of the directory listed in
   the ProfilePath (this is likely to be c:\windows\profiles\username),
   ask them if they have any important files stored on their desktop
   or in their start menu.  delete the contents of the directory
   ProfilePath (making a backup if any of the files are needed).

   This will have the effect of removing the local (read-only hidden
   system file) user.DAT in their profile directory, as well as the
   local "desktop", "nethood", "start menu" and "programs" folders.

4) search for the user's .PWL password-cacheing file in the c:\windows
   directory, and delete it.

5) log off the windows 95 client.

6) check the contents of the profile path (see "logon path" described
   above), and delete the user.DAT or user.MAN file for the user,
   making a backup if required.  


If all else fails, increase samba's debug log levels to between 3 and 10,
and / or run a packet trace program such as tcpdump or netmon.exe, and
look for any error reports.

If you have access to an NT server, then first set up roaming profiles
and / or netlogons on the NT server.  Make a packet trace, or examine
the example packet traces provided with NT server, and see what the
differences are with the equivalent samba trace.


Windows NT Workstation 4.0
--------------------------

When a user first logs in to a Windows NT Workstation, the profile
NTuser.DAT is created.  The profile location can be now specified
through the "logon path" parameter.  

[lkcl 10aug97 - i tried setting the path to
\\samba-server\homes\profile, and discovered that this fails because
a background process maintains the connection to the [homes] share
which does _not_ close down in between user logins.  you have to
have \\samba-server\%L\profile, where user is the username created
from the [homes] share].

There is a parameter that is now available for use with NT Profiles:
"logon drive".  This should be set to "h:" or any other drive, and
should be used in conjunction with the new "logon home" parameter.

The entry for the NT 4.0 profile is a _directory_ not a file.  The NT
help on profiles mentions that a directory is also created with a .PDS
extension.  The user, while logging in, must have write permission to
create the full profile path (and the folder with the .PDS extension)
[lkcl 10aug97 - i found that the creation of the .PDS directory failed,
and had to create these manually for each user, with a shell script.
also, i presume, but have not tested, that the full profile path must
be browseable just as it is for w95, due to the manner in which they
attempt to create the full profile path: test existence of each path
component; create path component].

In the profile directory, NT creates more folders than 95.  It creates
"Application Data" and others, as well as "Desktop", "Nethood",
"Start Menu" and "Programs".  The profile itself is stored in a file
NTuser.DAT.  Nothing appears to be stored in the .PDS directory, and
its purpose is currently unknown.

You can use the System Control Panel to copy a local profile onto
a samba server (see NT Help on profiles: it is also capable of firing
up the correct location in the System Control Panel for you).  The
NT Help file also mentions that renaming NTuser.DAT to NTuser.MAN
turns a profile into a mandatory one.

[lkcl 10aug97 - i notice that NT Workstation tells me that it is
downloading a profile from a slow link.  whether this is actually the
case, or whether there is some configuration issue, as yet unknown,
that makes NT Workstation _think_ that the link is a slow one is a
matter to be resolved].

[lkcl 20aug97 - after samba digest correspondance, one user found, and
another confirmed, that profiles cannot be loaded from a samba server
unless "security = user" and "encrypt passwords = yes" (see the file
ENCRYPTION.txt) or "security = server" and "password server = ip.address.
of.yourNTserver" are used.  either of these options will allow the NT
workstation to access the samba server using LAN manager encrypted
passwords, without the user intervention normally required by NT
workstation for clear-text passwords].

[lkcl 25aug97 - more comments received about NT profiles: the case of
the profile _matters_.  the file _must_ be called NTuser.DAT or, for
a mandatory profile, NTuser.MAN].


Windows NT Server
-----------------

There is nothing to stop you specifying any path that you like for the
location of users' profiles.  Therefore, you could specify that the
profile be stored on a samba server, or any other SMB server, as long as
that SMB server supports encrypted passwords.



Sharing Profiles between W95 and NT Workstation 4.0
---------------------------------------------------

NOTE! I think this is all bogus, but have not deleted it. (Richard Sharpe)


The default logon path is \\%N\U%.  NT Workstation will attempt to create
a directory "\\samba-server\username.PDS" if you specify the logon path
as "\\samba-server\username" with the NT User Manager.  Therefore, you
will need to specify (for example) "\\samba-server\username\profile".
NT 4.0 will attempt to create "\\samba-server\username\profile.PDS", which
is more likely to succeed.

If you then want to share the same Start Menu / Desktop with W95, you will
need to specify "logon path = \\samba-server\username\profile" [lkcl 10aug97
this has its drawbacks: i created a shortcut to telnet.exe, which attempts
to run from the c:\winnt\system32 directory.  this directory is obviously
unlikely to exist on a Win95-only host].

If you have this set up correctly, you will find separate user.DAT and
NTuser.DAT files in the same profile directory.

[lkcl 25aug97 - there are some issues to resolve with downloading of
NT profiles, probably to do with time/date stamps.  i have found that
NTuser.DAT is never updated on the workstation after the first time that
it is copied to the local workstation profile directory.  this is in
contrast to w95, where it _does_ transfer / update profiles correctly].
