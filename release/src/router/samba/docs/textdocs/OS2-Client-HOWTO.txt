Q. How can I configure OS/2 Warp Connect or OS/2 Warp 4 as a client for Samba?

A. A more complete answer to this question can be found on:
   http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/warp.html

   Basically, you need three components:

   * The File and Print Client ('IBM Peer')
   * TCP/IP ('Internet support') 
   * The "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver ('TCPBEUI')

   Installing the first two together with the base operating system on a blank
   system is explained in the Warp manual. If Warp has already been installed,
   but you now want to install the networking support, use the "Selective
   Install for Networking" object in the "System Setup" folder.

   Adding the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver is not described in the manual and
   just barely in the online documentation. Start MPTS.EXE, click on OK, click 
   on "Configure LAPS" and click on "IBM OS/2 NETBIOS OVER TCP/IP" in 
   'Protocols'.  This line is then moved to 'Current Configuration'. Select 
   that line, click on "Change number" and increase it from 0 to 1. Save this
   configuration.

   If the Samba server(s) is not on your local subnet, you can optionally add
   IP names and addresses of these servers to the "Names List", or specify a 
   WINS server ('NetBIOS Nameserver' in IBM and RFC terminology). For Warp 
   Connect you may need to download an update for 'IBM Peer' to bring it on 
   the same level as Warp 4. See the webpage mentioned above.


Q. How can I configure OS/2 Warp 3 (not Connect), OS/2 1.2, 1.3 or 2.x for
   Samba?

A. You can use the free Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2c Client for OS/2 from
   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/BusSys/Clients/LANMAN.OS2/
   See http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/lanman.html for more information on
   how to install and use this client. In a nutshell, edit the file \OS2VER 
   in the root directory of the OS/2 boot partition and add the lines

   20=setup.exe
   20=netwksta.sys
   20=netvdd.sys

   before you install the client. Also, don't use the included NE2000 driver
   because it is buggy. Try the NE2000 or NS2000 driver from
   <a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/network/ndis/">
   ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/network/ndis/</a> instead.


Q. Are there any other issues when OS/2 (any version) is used as a client?

A. When you do a NET VIEW or use the "File and Print Client Resource Browser",
   no Samba servers show up. This can be fixed by a patch from
   http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/fix.html
   The patch will be included in a later version of Samba. It also fixes a
   couple of other problems, such as preserving long filenames when objects
   are dragged from the Workplace Shell to the Samba server.
