===============================================================================

Password Handling:
------------------
Microsoft periodically release updates to all their operating systems. Some of
these are welcomed while others cause us to change the way we do things. Few
people like change, particularly if the change is unexpected. The best advice
always is to read the documentation provided BEFORE applying an update.

One of the recent Win95 updates (VRDRUPD.EXE) disables plain text (also called
clear text) password authentication. The effects of this updates are desirable
where MS Windows NT is providing the password authentication service. This
update is most undesirable where Samba must provide the authentication service
unless Samba has been specifically configured to use encrypted passwords _AND_
has been linked with the libdes library.

If the above conditions have not been complied with, and you are using Samba,
then Windows 95 clients will NOT be able to authenticate to a Samba server.

To re-enable plain text password capabilities AFTER applying this update
you must create a new value in the Windows 95 registry.

Either foillow the following procedure or just double click on the
file Win95_PlainPassword.reg for an easier way to do this.

Procedure:
1)	Launch the Registry Editor as follows:
	Click on:	/Start/Run
	Type "regedit" and press enter.

2)	Double click on:	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

3)	Locate the following Key:
	/HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/VxD/VNETSUP

4)	From the menu bar select Edit/New/DWORD Value

5)	Rename the entry from "New Value #1" to:
		EnablePlainTextPassword

6)	Press Enter, then double click on the new entry.
	A dialog box will pop up and enable you to set a value.
	You must set this value to 1.

Windows 95 Updates:
-------------------
When using Windows 95 OEM SR2 the following updates are recommended where Samba
is being used. Please NOTE that the above change will affect you once these
updates  have been installed.

There are more updates than the ones mentioned here. You are referred to the
Microsoft Web site for all currently available updates to your specific version
of Windows 95.

Kernel Update:	KRNLUPD.EXE
Ping Fix:	PINGUPD.EXE
RPC Update:	RPCRTUPD.EXE
TCP/IP Update:	VIPUPD.EXE
Redirector Update:	VRDRUPD.EXE

Also, if using MS OutLook it is desirable to install the OLEUPD.EXE fix. This
fix may stop your machine from hanging for an extended period when exiting
OutLook and you may also notice a significant speedup when accessing network
neighborhood services.
