=============================================================================

This might be relevant to Client Tuning. I have been trying various methods
of getting win95 to talk to Samba quicker. The results I have come up with
are:

1. Install the W2setup.exe file from www.microsoft.com. This is an 
update for the winsock stack and utilities which improve performance.

2. Configure the win95 TCPIP registry settings to give better 
perfomance. I use a program called MTUSPEED.exe which I got off the 
net. There are various other utilities of this type freely available. 
The setting which give the best performance for me are:

(a) MaxMTU                  Remove
(b) RWIN                    Remove
(c) MTUAutoDiscover         Disable
(d) MTUBlackHoleDetect      Disable
(e) Time To Live            Enabled
(f) Time To Live - HOPS     32
(g) NDI Cache Size          0

3. I tried virtually all of the items mentioned in the document and 
the only one which made a difference to me was the socket options. It 
turned out I was better off without any!!!!! 

In terms of overall speed of transfer, between various win95 clients 
and a DX2-66 20MB server with a crappy NE2000 compatible and old IDE 
drive (Kernel 2.0.30). The transfer rate was reasonable for 10 baseT.

The figures are:          Put              Get 
P166 client 3Com card:    420-440kB/s      500-520kB/s
P100 client 3Com card:    390-410kB/s      490-510kB/s
DX4-75 client NE2000:     370-380kB/s      330-350kB/s

I based these test on transfer two files a 4.5MB text file and a 15MB 
textfile. The results arn't bad considering the hardware Samba is 
running on. It's a crap machine!!!!

The updates mentioned in 1 and 2 brought up the transfer rates from 
just over 100kB/s in some clients.

A new client is a P333 connected via a 100MB/s card and hub. The 
transfer rates from this were good: 450-500kB/s on put and 600+kB/s 
on get.

Looking at standard FTP throughput, Samba is a bit slower (100kB/s 
upwards). I suppose there is more going on in the samba protocol, but 
if it could get up to the rate of FTP the perfomance would be quite 
staggering.
