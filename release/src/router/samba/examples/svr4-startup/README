Hi and thanks for this great software.

Solaris (and other sysv) machines have a standardized way of
starting and shutting down services (you may well know that already).

Here's a piece of code one could place under /etc/init.d
and create appropriate link from, say

   /etc/rc2.d/S99samba.server

to make smbd start and stop automatically with system bootups and
shutdowns. Each one should edit the lines containing the
daemon calls to agree with his/her installation (the code below
works with the defaults) and workgroup  setup (we use the -G and -n
options).


I hope this will be of use --- at least it is for me.

Yours,
