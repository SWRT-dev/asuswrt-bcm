The new smbmount syntax (as of Samba 2.0.6) allows a symlink to be
created from /sbin/mount.smb to smbmount. This allows mount to
recognise a filesystem type of smb. 

This means you can use smbmount with autofs by just specifying smb as
the filesystem type. See the smbmount man page for a full list of
options.

The server path to mount must be of the form ://server/share or
automount won't accept it. Also, you must make sure that smbmnt is in
the path so that it will be found by smbmount.
