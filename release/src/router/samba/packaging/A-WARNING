Please carefully review any script within the packaging directory tree to
ensure that it is safe to execute. If you do not have the skill to determine
that these scripts are safe then please do NOT use them.

If you wish to create and install samba binary files for your system it
may be better to change to the source directory and then run:

	./configure
	make
	make install
