Create Software Depot for Samba
-------------------------------

1. Compile the source code
   The packaging assumes that the final product will install under /opt/samba
   and will use /var/opt/samba for var directory. In order to support these
   assumptions, run configure as follows:

       ./configure --prefix /opt/samba --localstatedir /var/opt/samba

   Afterwards compile the source code in a standard way.

2. In packaging/HPUX directory run the following command:

    $ create_package.sh

3. Use resulting samba.depot file as the software depot for Samba.

Brief Description of Depot
--------------------------

The software depot contains product Samba, which consists of the following
three filesets:

    Samba.core        Core samba server components, everything but SWAT
                      and man pages

    Samba.man         Man pages. Note that HP-UX uses different section
                      numbering, so the man pages are moved and modified
                      to correct the section references (i.e. nmbd(8) changed
                      to nmbd(1m)).

    Samba.swat        SWAT tool.

The configure scripts will take care of the following:

    Samba.core        1. create pcguest account should it not exist. The
                         login shell is set to /usr/bin/true
                      2. create startup/shutdown links at:
                               /sbin/rc3.d/S911samba
                               /sbin/rc2.d/K130samba
                      3. copy boot configuration file from newconfig to
                         /etc/rc.config.d, if one does not exist.

   Samba.man          1. add /opt/samba/man to default man search path in
                         /etc/MANPATH

   Samba.swat         1. add swat service to /etc/services if necessary.
                         Swat will run through port 901.
                      2. add swat to /etc/inetd.conf, if necessary.
                      3. signal (SIGHUP) inetd to reread configuration if
                         1. or 2. were changed.

The unconfigure scripts will, upon the product removal, do the following:

   Samba.core         1. remove startup/shutdown links
                      2. remove user pcguest

   Samba.man          N/A

   Samba.swat         1. remove swat from /etc/services
                      2. remove swat from /etc/inetd.conf
                      3. signal inetd (SIGHUP) to reread configuration
