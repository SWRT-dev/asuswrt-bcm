Installation Instructions for HP-UX Software Distributor package
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run swinstall

  You may have copied (swcopy) the depot to the depot server. In such cases
  select the depot on server.

  In order to install from the depot file, as root enter the following
  command:

      swinstall -s `pwd`/samba.depot Samba

2. Create configuration file

  Create /opt/samba/lib/smb.cof. You can use one of the examples from
  /opt/samba/newconfig/examples as template.

3. Start/stop Samba

  The installation provides the boot startup script at /sbin/init.d/samba. 
  Samba will automatically start at run level 3 and stop during the 
  transition to run level 2.

  You can use this script to manually manipulate Samba. Enter:

     # /sbin/init.d/samba start       to start Samba
     # /sbin/init.d/samba stop        to stop Samba

4. Customization

  The autostart is controled by editing file /etc/rc.config.d/samba. This 
  file has the following variables:

	SAMBA_START=[0|1]      1   start Samba at boot (default)
                               0   do not start samba at boot

        SAMBA_DEBUG=[0-9]      debug level for smbd and nmbd. Default debug
                               level is 1.

  The configuration file is not overwritten at next install while the boot
  script (/sbin/init.d/samba) is.
