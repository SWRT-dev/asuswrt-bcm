# This script is an input filter for printcap printing on a unix machine. It
# uses the smbclient program to print the file to the specified smb-based 
# server and service.
# For example you could have a printcap entry like this
#
# smb:lp=/dev/null:sd=/usr/spool/smb:sh:if=/usr/local/samba/smbprint
#
# which would create a unix printer called "smb" that will print via this 
# script. You will need to create the spool directory /usr/spool/smb with
# appropriate permissions and ownerships for your system.

# Set these to the server and service you wish to print to 
# In this example I have a WfWg PC called "lapland" that has a printer 
# exported called "printer" with no password.

#
# Script further altered by hamiltom@ecnz.co.nz (Michael Hamilton)
# so that the server, service, and password can be read from 
# a /var/spool/lpd/PRINTNAME/.config file.
#
# In order for this to work the /etc/printcap entry must include an 
# accounting file (af=...):
#
#   cdcolour:\
#	:cm=CD IBM Colorjet on 6th:\
#	:sd=/var/spool/lpd/cdcolour:\
#	:af=/var/spool/lpd/cdcolour/acct:\
#	:if=/usr/local/etc/smbprint:\
#	:mx=0:\
#	:lp=/dev/null:
#
# The /usr/var/spool/lpd/PRINTNAME/.config file should contain:
#   server=PC_SERVER
#   service=PR_SHARENAME
#   password="password"
#
# E.g.
#   server=PAULS_PC
#   service=CJET_371
#   password=""

#
# Debugging log file, change to /dev/null if you like.
#
# logfile=/tmp/smb-print.log
logfile=/dev/null


#
# The last parameter to the filter is the accounting file name.
#   Extract the directory name from the file name.
#   Concat this with /.config to get the config file.
#
eval acct_file=\${$#}
spool_dir=`dirname $acct_file` 
config_file=$spool_dir/.config

# Should read the following variables set in the config file:
#   server
#   service
#   password
eval `cat $config_file`

#
# Some debugging help, change the >> to > if you want to save space.
#
echo "server $server, service $service" >> $logfile

(
# NOTE You may wish to add the line `echo translate' if you want automatic
# CR/LF translation when printing.
#       echo translate
	echo "print -"
	cat
) | /usr/bin/smbclient "//$server/$service" $password -U $server -N -P >> $logfile 2>&1
