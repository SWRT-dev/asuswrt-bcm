Note:
=====
This directory is a public repository for platform specific files including
build files for binary package distributions for specific operating systems
as well as for source file distribution packages for those systems.

The Example directory should be used as a guide for preparation of binary
packages for distribution via the official samba ftp sites.

The files contained here are intended for use only by those wishing to build
distribution packages and are NOT considered suitable material for anyone who
wants to just install Samba from the pristine source files contained under
the ~/source directory.

All contributions / modifications / additions / etc. to the packaging files
should be sent to samba-bugs@samba.org with the subject marked:
	PACKAGING: [add|mod|contrib] Your subject.

Should you, or anyone you know of, have package build instructions and/or files
that may be of use to the wider community of Samba users please mail the above
account with subject:  PACKAGING: [avail] OS xxxxxxxxxx
where xxxxxxxxxx is the operating system platform that may be contributed.

We will contact the person who is offering to contribute package build details
to ensure that their contribution can be included in the official Samba sources.

In the event that anyone wishes to contribute package build information please
indicate in your response how we may access a suitable system to ensure our
ability to keep the binary distribution itself current with the released source.

The future of cooperatively developed software such as Samba depends on the
willingness of all partners to share the fruit of their labours.
