Subject: Installation Instructions for Digital Unix v4.0
--------------------------------------------------------

1) cd /
2) tar xvf [path-to-]/install.tar
3) cd /usr/local/samba/lib
4) vi smb.conf

Now modify smb.conf to reflect your site needs.

5) samba start

To stop samba:

	samba stop

You could install samba to run from the system start-up scripts
(recommended) by running  ./setup.sh

Start / Stop Samba as follows:-

	samba [start | stop]


Subject: Encrypted password support
-----------------------------------

Encrypted password support is quite distinct from Digital Enhanced
Security Mode operation of the Unix system. Encrypted passwords
applies to the SMB connections serviced by this machine, not to
local user logons. Local user logons are services by the security
system chosen by your system administrator.

Digital Unix knows of either BASIC or ENHANCED security mode
operation. BASIC mode uses the traditional /etc/passwd database
containing Unix crypted passwords. ENHANCED mode uses a TCB database.
Samba-1.9.18p10 has been modified so that if OSF1_ENH_SEC is defined
at compile time then a password check will be made first using ENHANCED
mode and if that fails then it will try BASIC mode. This is the case
for this binary distribution - you need not recompile. In other
words: this binary distribution will work with either security mode.

To enable SMB encrypted password support do the following:

1) Put /usr/local/samba/bin in your PATH
2) Edit /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf and uncomment the
	line "encrypt passwd = yes"
3) Execute: smbpasswd -a "username" "password"

The above will create your /usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd file
in which will be the NT and LanMAN hashed passwords.
