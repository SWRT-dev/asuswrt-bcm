@mainpage Libical - an implementation of iCalendar protocols and data formats

@section about About

Libical is an Open Source implementation of the iCalendar protocols
and protocol data units. The iCalendar specification describes how
calendar clients can communicate with calendar servers so users can
store their calendar data and arrange meetings with other users. 

Libical implements RFC2445, RFC2446 and some of RFC2447.
