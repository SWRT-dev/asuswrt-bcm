 * The DBusMessageLoader object encapsulates the process of converting
 * a byte stream into a series of DBusMessage. It buffers the incoming
 * bytes as efficiently as possible, and generates a queue of
 * messages. DBusMessageLoader is typically used as part of a
 * DBusTransport implementation. The DBusTransport then hands off
 * the loaded messages to a DBusConnection, making the messages
 * visible to the application.
 *
 * @todo write tests for break-loader that a) randomly delete header
 * fields and b) set string fields to zero-length and other funky
 * values.
