Subject: Re[2]: Flex on an AS400

              I have no problem at all with being a contact for advice
          on porting Flex to EBCDIC.  The code was put on an AS400, so
          filing the message under /MISC/AS400 is more appropriate.
          The port was an interesting, very educational experience.
          Thanks again.

I came in late on this discussion - I don't follow comp.compilers very
closely these days because my job has shifted somewhat.

I ported (quite some time ago) flex 2.3.6 to an IBM 3090 under MVS, using
the SAS C compiler. The approach I used was, as Vern suggested, was to
translate the tables to reflect EBCDIC-based indices. I haven't even
downloaded flex 2.4 yet, so I don't know what's in the current distribution.
My patches were in the flex 2.3 distribution for a while in the MISC
directory. If you want any more info feel free to drop me a line - I still
have (somewhere) the patches that I created from version 2.3.6.
