ecmh - Easy Cast du Multi Hub

Easy Cast du Multi Hub (ecmh) is a networking daemon that relays
and aggregates multicast packets from/to network interfaces.

This allows IPv6 multicast routing on Linux and other OS's that
do not implement IPv6 multicast routing. It also allows IPv4 to
IPv6 and IPv6 to IPv4 translation of multicast traffic.
Allowing multicast where it is not available at the moment.
It also has a tunnel mode so that it can detect multicast
packets being tunneled inside protocol 41 (IPv6 in IPv4)
tunnels (RFC3056). This is for instance very handy for
projects like SixXS (http://www.sixxs.net) where we can
install this daemon on the POPs and let it easily do
multicast IPv6 allowing the m6bone (http://www.m6bone.net)
to grow and provide IPv6 multicast and because of the
translation also IPv4 multicast everywhere we would want it to be.
