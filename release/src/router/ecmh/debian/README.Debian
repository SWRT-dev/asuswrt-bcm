Easy Cast du Multi Hub for Debian
---------------------------------

Website: http://unfix.org/projects/ecmh/

This can be build by using the 'deb' target for make.
Which calls simply "debian/rules binary" ofcourse ;)

This should run out-of-the-box (read: deb) as user 
nobody as is being done on several of the SixXS POPs.
