Broken Multicast Support in Network card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Actually not a bug in ecmh, but one in the network card. Some do not
entirely support multicast properly and thus ecmh will never receive
a multicast packet at all. Note that this could be a driver or an
actual hardware problem. To solve this, mark the interface as 'promisc'
or pass the -p option to ecmh. This works for Vmware too btw.
