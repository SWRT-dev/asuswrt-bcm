ecmh (2004.02.18-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Releasing as 2004.02.18.
  * Added TTL decrementing, streams must set their Hop Limit
    to something like the usual 64 hops otherwise they will
    be discarded, as it is multicast, we do not return errors.
  * ICMPv6 Echo Requests work and nicely reply.
    Traceroutes should work using this btw.
    ping6 -I eth0 -t 1 radio.unfix.org, shows the first hop.
    ping6 -I eth0 -t 1 radio.unfix.org, shows the second one, etc.
  * Timeout now handled outside of signal handler, avoids
  * Gathers one global address per interface, this one is
    used when replying to ICMPv6 echo requests.
  * Added Hop Limit Exceeded counter.
  * Changed timeouts to the ECMH_ROBUSTNESS_FACTOR, it is now
    set to 3 instead of 2.
  * Added ECMH_OPTIONS to the main Makefile.
  * Noted in the src/Makefile that one should build from the main tree.
  * Added a help target to the toplevel Makefile.

  * Hopefully finally fixed lists and thus timeouts.
  * Using LIST_LOOP2() when deleting inside a loop.
  * Reductions to 0 cause an immediate MLD Query to be
    sent for only that specific group.
  * inet_ntop() argument fixes and using INET[6]_ADDRSTRLEN now.
  * -f argument fix, correctly setting it to false instead of true.
  * Set ECMH_SUBSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT to 125 per MLDv2 section 9.2.
  * Using list_delete_all_node(). instead of list_delete().
