Easy Cast du Multi Hub for RPM's
--------------------------------

Website: http://unfix.org/projects/ecmh/

This spec file is included, but as I don't have any
redhat boxes there won't be RPM's from my hand :)

Maybe the SourceForge Compile farm can provide those.
Will be looking into it later(tm)
