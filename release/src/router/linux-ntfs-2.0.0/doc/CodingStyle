The standard K&R coding style is used in this project and the guidelines
outlined in the Linux kernel CodingStyle document (found in the latest Linux
kernel main directory in Documentation/CodingStyle) should be adhered to as
strictly as possible.

Special notes:

	Capitals are used when declaring NTFS on-disk structures which you
	can't just go ahead modifying without getting killed (in a bug sense,
	not literally...).  In memory structures are named with lower case as
	usual.

	For styles that are not explicitly defined in the document or in the
	kernel one, check/read the kernel and/or libntfs source.  Some parts
	of the kernel might use unwanted coding styles but usually, e.g.
		linux/kernel/*
	has what Linus prefers/writes and most developers follow.

	The latest Linux kernel contains the script Lindent in the scripts/
	directory which formats the source the most preferred way.  Moreover,
	the below patch will be applied to the official kernel tree as well:
		http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/1/30/180
	Check indent(1) for what the used/unused (default) parameters mean.
