ntfsprogs 2.0.0
===============

ntfsmount (and libntfs) now has full basic read/write support.

Cryptographic code is now integrated into libntfs, thus ntfscat and ntfsmount
now can read encrypted files.  See "man 8 libntfs" for details.

ntfsresize (and the entirety of ntfsprogs/libntfs in fact) now have full
support for Windows Vista.

ntfsprogs and libntfs are now entirely endian safe and more over now we have
checks that automatically reports endian errors.

mkntfs now creates a DCE compliant GUID for the volume and does a few other
things to be more compliant with Windows Vista.
