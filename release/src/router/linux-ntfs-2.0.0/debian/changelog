linux-ntfs (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #444900).  ntfsmount sports full read/write,
    libntfs can read encrypted files and ntfsresize supports Vista.  Other
    interesting details are:
    - ntfsmount now creates files and directories with security descriptor
      that grant full access to everyone.
    - ntfsmount: Remove "show_sys_files" as potential harmful and introduce
      new "case_insensitive" option to support both case sensitive and
    - Allow mounting volumes with non-clean logfile with force mount option.
    - ntfsclone: Define endianness safe image format.
    - Introduce NTFS_MNT_FORENSIC mount option, otherwise the logfile gets
      wiped out by the mount attempt if it is not read-only.
    - mkntfs: Generate a random DCE compliant UUID for the created volume
      and include --with-uuid[=PFX] and --without-uuid options.
    - mkntfs: Always set default cluster size to 4096 bytes regardless of
      volume size.  This is what Windows Vista does and it makes perfect
      sense from a performance point of view.
    - mkntfs: As announced, remove the deprecated support for creation of
      NTFS 1.2/3.0 volumes.  It now creates NTFS 3.1 volumes only.
    - mkntfs: Create more Vista-like volumes.  It now matches the security
      descriptor attributes (but not yet the security descriptors stored in
      $Secure).
      insensitive mounts.
    - libntfs: Ignore bootsector checksum inconsistencies as too many 3rd
      party utilities update the boot sector without correcting the
      checksum.
    - ntfsdecrypt: Major improvement!  Now the .pfx file is validates to be
      the right type of RSA key and other safety checks.
    - Transparently integrate reading of encrypted files into library.  This
      adds a dependency on libconfig >= 1.0.1 to read list of PFX files with
      keys, imposible to have because that libconfig is not packaged in Debian
      (as far as I know).
    - Fixed lots of bugs along all the code, and also resolved endianness
      bugs.
    - Fixed typos (closes: #437893).
  * debian/control:
    - Added dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to Build-Depends in order to use
      ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version} in the dependency of
      libntfs-dev on libntfs9.  Thanks to Frank Küster (closes: #414124).
    - Added uuid-dev and dependency on libfuse-dev >= 2.7.0.
    - Commented out parts talking about ntfsdecrypt, as I need libconfig (not
      the one that is in Debian) packaged before.  This, apparently, closes:
      #427789.
  * Fixed some lintian errors.

linux-ntfs (1.13.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #367508):
    - Fixed lots of endianness bugs.
    - ntfscmp is now built as a regular tool (and thus included in this
      package).
    - ntfsresize checks and reports bad sectors before cluster allocation
      check.
    - mkntfs optionally creates NTFS version 3.0 (W2K) or 3.1 (XP, W2K3,
      Vista).
    - ntfsmount now support an 'streams_interface=' option to select named data
      streams access interface.  Currently supported interfaces are 'none',
      'windows' and 'xattr'.
    - ntfscat can display named attributes, streams too.
    - Working with regular files no longer needs the --force option, except
      for mkntfs.
    - ntfsclone checks available free space on the destination before
      starting to clone, image or restore.
    - Fix the -u option in ntfsundelete.  Instead of a confusing optional
      parameter, there's a new option -i with a required parameter.
    - mkntfs had a fix for a segfault when volume had more than 2^31 clusters.
    - ntfsmount has FreeBSD support.
    - Implement simple syslog logging handler in ntfsmount.
    - Fix a lot of bugs in attribute resizing code.
    - ntfsclone: the --metadata option will wipe the timestamps in the
      index allocation attributes as well.  This further decreases the
      compressed metadata image size by 10-25% and more importantly it
      eliminates non-interesting ntfscmp differences.
    - ntfsinfo: dump either a minimal (default) or the entire attribute
      header (--verbose) for all attribute types.
    - ntfscmp supports bad cluster list, compares full attribute headers
      for non-resident attributes, and is built by default.
    - Fix bug with renaming directories with names in DOS and WIN32
      namespaces.
    - Lots of various bug fixes.
  * debian/control:
    - Changed URL to the new site (closes: #356217).
    - Added libgnutls-dev (>> 1.4.0) to Build-depends in order to enable
      again ntfsdecrypt.
    - Removed completely fake ntfstools package, as it was a dummy one in
      sarge.  Thanks to Stefan Huehner for noticing (closes: #369106).
    - While at it, renamed ntfstools-udeb to ntfsprogs-udeb for consistency.
      Added Provides: ntfstools-udeb, trying to ease transitions.
    - Rename libntfs8 to libntfs9.
    - Upgrade Standards-Version to 3.7.2.0.
    - Rewrote description for ntfsfix, as it has evolved to a general-purpose
      checking tool for NTFS filesystems, that also forces a check on the next
      Windows boot.  Thanks to Szaka for the hint.
    - Added ntfscmp and ntfsdecrypt descriptions.
  * debian/rules:
    - Added --enable-crypto to ./configure parameter line, thus enabling
      building of ntfsdecrypt.  Please read changelog from 1.11.2-1 release
      for learning more about it.
    - Link against libntfs9.
  * Added libntfs.conf to libntfs-gnomevfs package.
  * Moved usr/share/man/man8/libntfs-gnomevfs.8 to libntfs-gnomevfs package.
  * Removed test/runlist-data/CVS/ dir from source.
  * Correct wrong symlink in /sbin/mount.ntfs-fuse.  Thanks, Onur Can CAKMAK.
    Closes: #357906.

linux-ntfs (1.12.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #332930):
    - Fixed lots of memory leaks in the tools.
    - ntfsmount now uses the new API, and it has several fixes.
    - Support journals which have been modified by chkdsk.
    - New API for creating hard links, index handling, high-level creation and
      deletion of files and directories.
    - New utility ntfscmp (make extra) which compares two NTFS volumes and
      tell the differences. It's used for development, debugging, testing, etc.
    - Added robustness to several tools.
    - ntfsclone: fix saving by sectors during --rescue.
    - ntfsmount: Add 'locale' option and change interface to 'ntfsmount device
      mount_point'.
    - Fixed problem with kernel 2.4 and mkntfs.
    - Change ALL utilities to display the libntfs version they are running on.
      This should make debugging easier in the case that people are running
      mismatched utilities/library.
  * This new release fixes problems with libfuse 2.4.0 (closes: #336357).
  * Fixed a lot of typos in the manpages, kindly submitted by A Costa. Thanks!
    (closes: #336143, #336144, #336145, #336147, #336148).
  * Fixed a couple of typos by me.
  * debian/control: The SONAME of libntfs was bumped. Created new package
    (libntfs8) and removed the old one.
  * debian/copyright: Updated the FSF postal address.
  * Added debian/ntfsprogs.links in order to ship mkfs.ntfs and
    mount.ntfs-fuse.

  * debian/control: Fixed references to libntfs5 in libntfs-dev (closes:

linux-ntfs (1.11.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really build ntfsmount, I forgot to add libfuse-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Removed ntfscrypt building, until libgnomevfs2-dev depends on a modern
    libgnutls. Sorry, guys.
  * debian/control: Added libfuse-dev to Build-Depends, and removed
    libgnutls-dev.

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Aug 2005 01:11:36 +0200

linux-ntfs (1.11.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Changes were:
    - ntfsclone: added a new option, --rescue. It ignores read errors so
      disks having bad sectors (dying disks) can be rescued efficiently,
      with minimal stress on them. --rescue works at the lowest, sector and
      not cluster level, thus more data can be rescued. Also honor bad
      clusters list.
    - ntfscp: add ability to specify directory as destination file. Add
      --attribute, --attr-name and --inode options. ntfscp now is a standard
      program, not extra.
    - ntfsfix: fix invalid mft records in $MFTMirr.
    - ntfsinfo: it has been extended and now provides much more detailed
      information as well as being able to resolve a path/filename instead of
      requiring the inode number.
    - ntfsresize: support bad clusters list, i.e. disks having bad sectors, if
      the new --bad-sectors option is used.
    - Add new utility, ntfsmount. It is a FUSE module that relies on libntfs.
    - Add new utilities: ntfsdecrypt.
    - ntfsdecrypt is now fully functional using libgcrypt and gnutls 1.2.0
      (not later, that is broken at present).  It decrypts all types of
      compressed files that NTFS creates, i.e. DesX, AES-256, and 3Des.  The
      only thing it requires is the user's private key which needs to be
      supplied via a .pfx file (a PKCS#12 file). Such a file can be created
      in Windows XP SP2 by running cipher with the export key option or in
      older Windows versions by running the certificates snap-in to the
      Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Note that due to a bug in gnutls
      you have to protect the .pfx file with a password. An empty password
      will not work.
    - Add new utilities: ntfsdecrypt, ntfsmftalloc.
    - And lots of fixes and improved error handling in every utility.

  * debian/control:
    - Made ntfstools package deborphan-compliant (added dummy/transitional to
      the Description).
    - Fixed typo in the Description (closes: #300073).
    - Added hint for mkntfs in the Description about making the new partition
      bootable.
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.2.
    - Added --enable-crypto to configure in order to make ntfsdecrypt.

linux-ntfs (1.9.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - The conflict with ntfstools should be versioned. Thanks, Joerg (closes:

    - Dropped from Build-Depends field completely gcc, as the version shipped
      with sarge will be >= 3:3.2.3.

linux-ntfs (1.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Changes were:
    - Lots of fixes to libntfs.
    - Many endian issues fixed.
    - Fixes for Solaris and Win32.
    - General enhancements to ntfsinfo, ntfsundelete, ntfsclone and ntfslabel.
    - Now ntfsclone has special image format support.
  * New utilities added:
    - ntfswipe - wipe file tails and directory indexes.
    - ntfscp - at present it can only overwrite files.
  * debian/control:
    - Added info about ntfscluster (I forgot to did it some time ago),
      ntfswipe and ntfscp.
    - Readded the ntfstools legacy package.

linux-ntfs (1.9.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a ntfstools-udeb containing a space-efficient ntfsresize.
    Thanks, Joey Hess (closes: #265617).

    conflict that Adrian Bunk observed. ntfsprogs Provides: and Replaces:
    ntfstools (closes: #266132).

linux-ntfs (1.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Among others, main changes follow:
    - A mostly rewritten ntfsinfo, with significant enhancements (dump by
      path/filename, much more detailed information).
    - mkntfs now creates bootable volumes.
    - Some 64-bit architecture fixes. These users are recommended to upgrade.
    - Three bugs in the decompression code. Upgrade is strongly recommended if
      you are accessing compressed files.
    - Lots of cleanups and improvements.
  * Changed name from ntfstools to ntfsprogs. Now ntfstools is a fake package.
    Reverted all my previous changes back to original, including manpages
    (closes: #245413).

linux-ntfs (1.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Merged Debian diff with upstream.
    - Fixed mkntfs for large volumes.
    - Add relocation support to ntfsresize. This modifies the command line
      options a little as well as the returned output so applications using
      ntfsresize might need modifications before they will work with the
      updated ntfsresize.
    - Revamped the build system completely.
    - Provide always own byteswap constant versions in order to avoid the mess
      that some architectures define only some of them (read m68k, ppc,
      mips...).
    - Made the warnings on 64 bit architectures go away.
    - Fixed lots of typos in the documentation.
    - Lots of fixes in general.
  * Resolved several FTBFS (Fail To Build From Source) bugs (closes: #226989,
    #234104). With this, all the architectures go in sync again.

 -- David Martínez Moreno <ender@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Mar 2004 00:03:30 +0100

linux-ntfs (1.8.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Among others fixes, copy needed things from kernel headers (closes:
      #223170).
    - A lot of fixes: the build has lots of compiler warnings enabled, thus
      fixing all the warnings from libntfs.
    - Found two bugs that could cause data corruption (closes: #228422,
      #229239). Hence the urgency.
    - Extended the API.
    - Updated ntfsinfo.
  * I'm almost sure that #234104 and #226989 are related and fixed in this
    release, but we'll wait to the buildd's to see if this release fixes the
    FTBFS error.
  * I cannot reproduce #229497 and #229498 neither with 1.8.0-2 or this...weird.

linux-ntfs (1.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (closes: #183954).
  * Highlights of this release are the now hopefully stable API supported by
    an almost completely rewritten library and the new utilities: ntfsresize,
    ntfsundelete, ntfsinfo and ntfslabel (closes: #176635).
  * Also this release is more robust and fixes a lot of errors, hence the
    urgency.
  * debian/control: Bumped to debhelper v4, removed gcc less than 3.2.
    Standards-Version to 3.5.8. Rewrote Description in order to reflect the
    robustness of the new API and the new utilities. Removed ending full

    powerpc...the buildd's are getting into trouble.

linux-ntfs (1.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * ntfsfix had two minor bugs fixed. This also should remove
    the compilation warnings in ntfsfix.c on 64-bit-pointer-size
    architectures.
  * Oh, yes, THIS release _will_ compile and work on all
    architectures... ;-)
  * Hopefully will do. The sole changes are those allowing
    compilation in sparc and ia64 targets. #123305 will be
    closed when I see that.

linux-ntfs (1.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * This release should now compile and work on all architectures.
    Anton (upstream) said that atomic stuff is now gone, but I'm
    not going to close #123305 yet until I see/test linux-ntfs
    on other architectures != i386...
  * Now ntfs_mount syntax is changed to accept a read-only flag.
  * Bumped SONAME in libntfs, from 2 to 3. 
  * debian/rules: General cleanup, and passing of CFLAGS in the
    command line to configure, thus honoring DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    and removing ugly hack in configure.
  * debian/control: Changed back Arquitecture: field to any. Let's
    test those unused buildd's... :-)
  * Cleaned a bit the .diff.gz, and updated several little things.

linux-ntfs (1.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems that atomic* stuff isn't present in non-386
    architectures, so we're disabling for now the autobuilding
    for arch!=i386. This closes: #120373, #121689.

linux-ntfs (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * mkntfs now allows creation of small NTFS volumes (current
    minimum size is 1 MB). Note, Windows does not normally
    support NTFS floppies but Linux now does.
  * ntfsfix now works on Windows XP NTFS volumes (NTFS 3.1).
  * mkntfs now correctly handles directories on volumes with large
    clusters.
  * Updated Standards-Version.
  * Corrected stupid changes in 1.2.2-1 about libntfs1.
  * Now this package builds libntfs2 instead of libntfs1 (changed
    SONAME).
  * Fixed creation of development library, thanks to Jose C. Garc­a
    Sogo <jsogo@debian.org>.

linux-ntfs (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * This is a small update which fixes a bug in mkntfs which only
    occured when formatting small volumes with non-standard sector
    sizes (i.e. non-512 byte).
  * Added Build-Depends on gcc-3.0, and on gcc-2.96 in ia64. Thanks,
    James Troup <james@nocrew.org> for the hint on ia64 :-)
    (Closes: #114495).
  * Fixed double dependency on libntfs1 as reported by lintian 1.20.16.
  * Removed almost all the patches as upstream now reflects them.

linux-ntfs (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Initial public release (closes: #107205).
  * Bug fixes for cluster sizes > 4 kb involving corrections to mft mirror
    size and contents, mft data attribute position and mft bitmap size.
  * Since 1.0.2 the tools ntfsdump_logfile, dumplog and ldm are no
    longer part of ntfstools, so we only ship ntfsfix and mkntfs now.
    Anton (the upstream author) claims that the dumplog tools are
    intended for developer use only, so they'll live only in the CVS.
  * If you're interested in this package including the above tools,
    please contact me. I don't know if there is such needing.
  * Added manual page for ntfsfix (should go upstream for the next version).

linux-ntfs (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
