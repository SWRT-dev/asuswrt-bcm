Here are the things I would like (or I should) do for the next releases:

* Add more statistics to sar and mpstat (and iostat) when available in Linux
  kernels.

* Add a real web-based graphical front-end to sar. I need help for this!

* Add support for hotplug memory?

* Dynamically allocate structures for IRQs (just like for CPUs).
