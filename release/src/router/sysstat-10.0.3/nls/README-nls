WHAT IS NLS?
------------
NLS stands for National Language Support. It encompasses the features that make
a program able to support different languages and cultural habits.
This touches the messages displayed on the screen, but also the format used to
display the dates or the numbers for example.


HOW I ENABLE NLS WITH SYSSTAT?
------------------------------
NLS is enabled by default when you configure sysstat (running "./configure").
But you can disable it if you want: Use the option "--disable-nls" with
./configure or answer 'y' (for 'yes') to the question:
"Disable National Language Support (NLS)? (y/n) [--disable-nls]"
if you use the interactive configuration script (iconfig).


OK, BUT HOW DO I USE IT NOW?
----------------------------
To see sysstat's messages in your own language, you have to set your LANG
environment variable to the proper value. For example, in France you may
want to set it to "fr_FR", although other possibilities exist. If this does
not work for your language, see below for how to add a new translation.

If you use bash and you want to configure your system for a French environment,
enter:

$ export LANG=fr_FR

('$' is the prompt).
If you use the (Tab) C shell, you would have entered:

% setenv LANG fr_FR

('%' is the prompt).
Here is a complete example with iostat:

$ export LANG=en_US
$ iostat -V 
sysstat version 5.1.4

Usage: iostat [ options... ] [ <interval> [ <count> ] ]
Options are:
[ -c | -d ] [ -k ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ]
[ { <device> [ ... ] | ALL } ] [ -p [ { <device> | ALL } ] ]

$ export LANG=fr_FR
$ iostat -V
sysstat version 5.1.4
(C) Sebastien Godard
Utilisation: iostat [ options... ] [ <intervalle> [ <itérations> ] ]
Options possibles:
[ -c | -d ] [ -k ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ]
[ { <device> [ ... ] | ALL } ] [ -p [ { <device> | ALL } ] ]


HOW CAN I ADD OR UPDATE A TRANSLATION?
--------------------------------------
At the present time, sysstat is already translated into several languages.
If, however, the translation to your language is incomplete or entirely
missing, you can update it or add a new one by contacting the team for
your language at the Translation Project -- http://translationproject.org/ .
There you can get the latest sysstat PO file for your language, or the
latest blank POT file. When you have made the translation complete, send it
to your team leader or to the team's mailing list.
