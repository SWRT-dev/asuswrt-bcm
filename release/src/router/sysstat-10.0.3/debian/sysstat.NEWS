sysstat (8.1.6-1) experimental; urgency=low

    Upstream replaced previous options -I or -d with the new -S, which
    is used to select activities that should be collected.
    ** Please make sure to update your /etc/default/sysstat file. **

sysstat (6.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

    The sysstat 6.0.0 stopped gathering disk statistics data ;(
    This release brings them back. Now, the data should be be default
    collected, but this feature can be easily disabled by editing the 
    /etc/default/sysstat file if you like.
    
    Please make sure to *ALLOW DPKG TO OVERWRITE* sysstat's configuration 
    files for the above change to work.
  
    The sa2 script has been changed to generate report for the previous day 
    instead of the current.
