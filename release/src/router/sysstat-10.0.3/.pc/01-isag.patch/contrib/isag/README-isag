README file for the isag - Interactive System Activity Graph - command.

isag is a command that enables you to plot data stored in a daily data file
by a previous sar run.
isag needs a recent version of Tcl/Tk installed, together with the
gnuplot plotting program.

isag is (C) 2000,2001 by David Doubrava <linux_monitor@volny.cz>.
Send bug reports to <linux_monitor@volny.cz>.

Note that the path to daily data files is hard coded in isag and
its value is "/var/log/sa".
Also isag assumes that sar is installed in /usr/bin directory.
