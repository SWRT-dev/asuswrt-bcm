Answer y if you want to remove existing daily data files from
system activity directory that were created by a previous
version of sysstat.
Removing those files may be compulsory if they have been created
with a format which is no longer compatible with that of current
sysstat version.
Default answer is n (files are not deleted).
You can still remove them by hand afterwards if sar yields the
following error: "Invalid system activity file".
