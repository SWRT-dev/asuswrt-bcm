The sa2 shell script creates daily reports, saved in /var/log/sa directory
(default location).
It also removes daily data files and reports which are older than a number
of days. This number defaults to 7 (one week of data history).
Answer here the number of days during which a daily data file or a report
should be kept.
Note that this parameter is saved in the /etc/sysconfig/sysstat file.
