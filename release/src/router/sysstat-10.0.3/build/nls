NLS stands for National Language Support.
With NLS enabled, the sysstat utilities will behave in accordance with your
current locale. Sysstat messages will be translated into the language specified
by the LANG environment variable, among other.
Read the nls/README-nls file for more information.
So you should not disable NLS support by default.
Note that NLS needs the GNU gettext package to work.
