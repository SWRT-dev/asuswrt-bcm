To prevent sar daily datafiles from taking to much space on disk, you can
ask the sa2 shell script to compress them (using gzip or bzip2) after a
certain amount of time.
Answer here the number of days after which datafiles are to be compressed
(default value is 10 days).
Note that this parameter is saved in the /etc/sysconfig/sysstat file.
