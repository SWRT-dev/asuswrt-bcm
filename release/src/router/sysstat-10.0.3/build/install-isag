Answer y if you want to install the isag command.
isag, the Interactive System Activity Grapher, is a graphical frontend
to sar. It graphically displays the system activity data stored
in a binary data file by a previous sar run.
Although included in the sysstat package (in the contrib directory), isag is
not necessarily kept in sync with sar. That's why it is not installed by default.
