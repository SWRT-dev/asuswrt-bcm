	  CPU frequency statistics are available.
	* sadc updated: Option "-S POWER" tells sadc to collect power
	  management statistics.
	* sadf command updated to take into account power management
	  statistics.
	* [Mike Harvey]: No longer truncate the interval of time to

	* [Ivana Varekova]: Make iostat display statistics for devices only
	  (and not partitions) when not using its option -d. This was
	  no longer possible with kernels 2.6.25 and later because iostat
	  couldn't distinguish between devices and partitions any more.
	* iostat's options -x and -p are no longer mutually exclusive:
	  Extended statistics are now available even for partitions with
	  recent kernels.
	* iostat was unable to read stats from sysfs for devices who had
	  a slash in their names (for example, iostat -p /dev/cciss/c0d0
	  didn't work properly before). This is now fixed.
	* [Amir Rapson]: Fixed a bug in iostat where %CPU spent
	  servicing hard and soft irq were counted twice. This bug
	  was introduced in 8.1.5.

	* [David Alan Gilbert]: Option -h added to pidstat. This
	  option is used to display all activities horizontally on a
	  single line.
	* Fixed a bug in pidstat: When pidstat was used to monitor a
	  process and all its threads (with pidstat's option -t), it
	  could display weird values if the thread group leader terminated.
	* Header line displayed by sar, iostat, mpstat, pidstat and
	  sadf -H now includes the number of CPU.
	* Use the correct word TGID instead of PID with pidstat -t.
	* mpstat now displays stats for all interrupts, including NMI,
	  LOC, etc.
	* sar and sadf now check that CPU activity is available in file.
	* iostat's option -t now always displays the date and the time.
	* Added option "--disable-documentation" to ./configure. Using
	  this option prevents documentation files (including manual
	  pages) from being installed.
	* iconfig script updated. Now ask the user for documentation
	  and isag script installation.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* NLS updated. Indonesian and Chinese (traditional) translations
	  added.
	* README-nls file updated.
	* Makefile updated: There is now a dedicated target to install
	  or uninstall NLS files
	* FAQ updated.
	* CREDITS file updated.
	* Code cleaned.

2008/07/14: Version 8.1.5 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> orange.fr)
	* Added virtual machine time accounting to "sar -u ALL" and
	  mpstat (%guest).
	* pidstat has also been updated to be able to display time
	  spent in virtual machine for a task, and for a task and all
	  its children.
	* Option -S added to sar: This options tells sar to display
	  swap space utilization. Option -r now only displays memory
	  utilization.
	* Added %swpcad to sar -S (percentage of cached swap memory
	  in relation to the amount of used swap space).
	* Added kbcommit and %commit to sar -r (amount and percentage
	  of memory needed for current workload).
	* sadf -x now distinguishes between options -r and -R.
	* sadf command updated to take into account new fields
	  (%guest, %swpcad, etc.)
	* [Ivana Varekova]: iostat now displays the total number of
	  operations per second in the NFS report.
	* Fixed iostat so that %system (percentage of CPU utilization
	  that occurred while executing at system level) also takes
	  into account time spent to service interrupts and softirqs.
	* Added a missing header line for activities with multiple
	  outputs displayed by sar (eg. sar -rR ...).
	* Makefile updated: There is now a dedicated target to install
	  or uninstall manual pages.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* Code cleaned.
	* XSD and DTD documents updated.
	* isag script updated.

2008/06/22: Version 8.1.4 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> orange.fr)

	  option "-u ALL". sadf has also been updated to be able to
	  display them.
	* mpstat can now display per-CPU interrupts statistics with its
	  option "-I CPU". This was a feature available in sar that was
	  removed in previous sysstat version.
	* mpstat uses now a separate option ("-I SUM") to display the
	  total number of interrupts for each processor.
	* Option -A added to mpstat. This switch tells mpstat to display
	  all possible activities.
	* NFS v4 support added to sar -n NFS(D). When both NFS v3 and
	  NFS v4 are used, stats from NFS v3 and NFS v4 are added
	  together [DEBIAN bug#434442].
	* Code cleaned: mpstat, iostat and pidstat now use the common
	  functions from rd_stats.c to read CPU stats from /proc/stat;
	  Computing extended disk statistics (service time, etc.) is now
	  done in one place (common function used by iostat, sar, sadf).
	* All sysstat commands are made consistent with how parameters
	  are interpreted: "COMMAND <interval>" now generates a report
	  continuously, "COMMAND <interval> 0" causes an error,
	  "COMMAND 0" displays a report since system startup
	  [DEBIAN bug#475707].
	* Changed XML output for processes and context switches displayed
	  by sadf -x to be consistent with output from sar.
	* mpstat and sar manual pages updated.
	* isag script updated.
	* FAQ updated.
	* DTD and XML Schema updated.
	* NLS updated.

2008/05/25: Version 8.1.3 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> orange.fr)
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! [0x2170]
	* sar, sadc and sadf heavily modified. It is now easier to add
	  (or remove) activities since sar and sadc have been rewritten
	  in a non-monolithic way with a generic design architecture.
	* Option -c removed from sar. Task creation and context switch
	  activities are now merged and available with option -w.
	* sar no longer displays interrupts per processor statistics.
	  This feature will be included in mpstat in next sysstat version.
	* Option -S added to sadc. This option replaces previous options
	  -I or -d, and is used to select activities that should be
	  collected and saved in file. It is even possible to
	  select each activity collected by sadc.
	* Format of data files created by sar/sadc heavily modified.
	  In some cases, it is now possible to add or remove activities
	  while keeping a compatible format that can be read by a previous
	  or future sysstat version.
	* sadf now only displays activities that have been explicitly
	  selected.
	* sar now checks that devices displayed by option -d are whole
	  devices (and not partitions) using sysstat.ioconf configuration
	  file. If this file is not found in its default directory, then
	  sysstat looks for it in current directory.
	* gettextize entire usage() messages so that translators have
	  free scope to act.
	* DTD and XML Schema updated.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* Crontab samples updated.
	* FAQ updated.
	* Code cleaned.

	* [Ivana Varekova]: iostat now displays read and write operations
	  per second in the NFS report.
	* [Tomas Mraz]: sadc now retries to write its buffers when the
	  write() call has been interrupted by a signal.
	* Use setbuf() call instead of fflush() to indicate that data
	  should not be buffered to stdout.
	* Option -h added to sadf. Used with options -d or -D, it
	  indicates that all activities should be displayed horizontally
	  on a single line of data.
	* sadf -d and sadf -D now display the list of fields for easier
	  data reading.
	* sadf and iostat manual pages updated.
	* NLS updated: Chinese (simplified) translation added, other
	  translations updated.

2008/02/10: Version 8.1.1 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> orange.fr)

	  sadf -x also displays machine architecture.
	* DTD and XML Schema documents updated.
	* The number of processors was not properly calculated on
	  machines where a directory named cpuidle was present in the
	  /sys/devices/system/cpu directory [GENTOO bug# 207886].
	* Use __CPU_SETSIZE definition from <sched.h> instead of a
	  static definition for the maximum number of CPUs (NR_CPUS).
	* Improved error messages displayed by sysstat's commands.
	* NLS updated: Finnish translation added, Dutch translation
	  updated.
	* FAQ updated.
	* Code cleaned and documented. Linux-like style applied to
	  code source. Large functions split into smaller ones.

2008/01/06: Version 8.0.4 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> orange.fr)
	* Removed a 'packed' attribute in pidstat.h that generated
	  a warning with gcc 4.1.1.
	* Take account of all memory zone types when calculating
	  pgscank, pgscand and pgsteal displayed by sar -B.

	  mutually exclusive.
	* Stricter iostat syntax checking: -k and -m options are now
	  mutually exclusive.
	* iostat: option -m is now taken into account even when
	  displaying extended statistics.
	* Fixed a bug that prevented iostat from displaying stats about
	  devices that were unknown in sysstat.ioconf file.

	* Small code change so that sysstat may be compiled with gcc-4.0.
	* A few typos fixed in formulas used by sadf to display stats 
	  on machines where HZ<>100 (typos appeared in sysstat 5.1.4).

	  is actually not...
	* Fixed sar -i option which might not select records at the specified
	  interval on machines with multiple processors.
	* NLS updated and cleaned. Do no longer translate fields names (sar,

	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! [0x2166]
	* NFS client and server statistics added to sar.
	* sar -d now only reads stats for devices (and not partitions)

	  /proc/diskstats).
	* Display routines from sadf merged, so that -ppc and -db
	  always output the same values.
	* sadf updated to handle NFS statistics.
	* sadf can now display the header of a data file (option -H).
	* Define MAX_BLKDEV in ioconf.h if non-existent in <linux/major.h>.
	* sar now looks for sadc in one directory only, specified at

	  display device names as they appear in /dev.
	* sysstat.ioconf support added.
	* New fields added to sar -d (more disk activities displayed):
	  avgrq-sz, avgqu-sz, await, svctm, %util.
	* sadf updated to handle new disk activities.
	* I/O and transfer rate statistics as displayed by sar -b are
	  available whatever the version of the kernel is (i.e. even on
	  recent kernels).
	* Disk stats are read by sadc from /proc/stat only if they cannot
	  be read from /proc/{partitions,diskstats}.
	* sadc: Some variables declarations moved around.
	* sar manual page updated.
	* Added workaround for EMC PowerPath driver bug to enable iostat
	  to display proper device name.
	* Makefile updated: Use $@ and $< everywhere; 'make {iostat,mpstat}'
	  work again; Create object files before linking; Removed unused
	  IOS_DFLAGS variable; Use DESTDIR variable everywhere; Create
	  libsysioc.a; Install sysstat.ioconf.

2004/11/05: Version 5.1.2 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	* sar -d now also uses /proc/partitions to get its data.
	  From now on sar -d looks in the following files in that order:
	  /proc/diskstats, /proc/partitions, /proc/stat.
	* sadc writes disks data to file only if -d option is explicitly
	  set on the command line.
	* sadc now reads individual interrupts data from /proc/stat only
	  if -I option was entered on the command line.
	* 'sar -A' is now equivalent to 'sar -bBcdqrRuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL
	  -n FULL -P ALL' (i.e. individual interrupts are also included
	  in activities).
	* Option -m now tells iostat to display statistics in megabytes
	  per second instead of blocks per second.
	* Make history (number of days to keep log files) configurable
	  in /etc/sysconfig/sysstat file, which is used by sa2 script.
	* Now use Vixie cron to launch sadc when possible.
	* sadc, sa1 and sa2 may now be installed in another directory
	  than ${PREFIX}/lib/sa. This is useful on 64-bit systems where
	  the proper directory should be ${PREFIX}/lib64/sa.
	* When uninstalling sysstat, always delete sysstat script,
	  config file and links in /etc tree. Also always delete
	  Vixie cron entry.
	* sysstat script now returns real exit code.
	* sar/sadc: Stricter syntax checking for -x and -X options use.
	* sysstat "*.sh" files renamed in "*.in".

2004/10/09: Version 5.1.1 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! [0x2164]
	* sar now reads CPU data, number of context switches, number
	  of sectors and total number of interrupts as 64-bit unsigned
	  values. It also reads the number of running processes as
	  unsigned long instead of unsigned int.
	* sadf - System activity data formatter command added.
	* Options -h and -H removed from sar. "sar -h" is replaced by
	  "sadf -p", and "sar -H" is replaced by "sadf -d". Read sadf
	  manual page, as its syntax is a bit different from that of sar.
	* Common code for sar and sadf moved to sa_common.c file.
	* pid_stats members don't need to be aligned since these stats
	  are not written to daily data files. Packing them saves some
	  memory on 32-bit architectures.
	* No longer indicate that -x and -X are possible options for sadc.
	  They are only useful when used as options for sar, not sadc.
	* Minor buffer overrun fixed in iostat.
	* Updated CPU header for iostat and mpstat: CPU used while executing
	  at the system level is displayed as '%system' by iostat (like sar)
	  and as '%sys' by mpstat.
	* sadf manual page added. Other manual pages updated.
	* Updated the GPL notices (the address of the FSF was wrong).
	* Makefile updated.
	* NLS updated.
	* README, FAQ and CREDITS files updated.

2004/08/09: Version 5.0.6 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	* The value for file-sz reported by sar -v was a number of free
	  handles, and not a number of used ones! This is now fixed (and
	  this is really now a number of _used_ file handles).
	* Now ask during config stage for the directory where sadc will
	  be located. This may be useful for some systems where sadc
	  needs to be installed in a specific location (e.g. on 64 bit
	  s390 systems, the proper directory should be /usr/lib64/sa).
	* sa1 script updated: Use '-' to specify current daily data file
	  instead of guessing its name using current date.
	* NLS updated: be consistent with GNU gettext standards.
	* iostat manual page updated.
	* FAQ updated.
	* Makefile updated.
	* CREDITS file updated.

2004/06/08: Version 5.0.5 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	* Timestamp is no longer limited to 11 characters. This should
	  avoid problems with somes locales (for example Japanese locale,
	  where 'mojibake' used to be displayed by sar and mpstat sometimes).
	* Fixed a bug in sysstat RPM spec file (symlinks to sysstat
	  script were wrong in /etc/rc.d directories).
	* sar now checks parameters for options -n, -s and -e more
	  aggressively.
	* NLS updated: Japanese translation added.
	* Various typos fixed in several files (manual pages, README, etc.)
	* CREDITS file updated.

2004/05/20: Version 5.0.4 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	* When trying to lock file, sadc now checks for both EWOULDBLOCK
	  and EAGAIN error codes to be portable.
	* sar could sometimes display a line whose time stamp was greater
	  than the limit set by -e option. This is no longer possible.
	* The sadc command in sysstat.sh script had to be enclosed in
	  quotes to work when called via 'su -c'.
	* The sysstat.sh script was sending the output of sadc command
	  to stdout instead of the standard system activity file. This
	  is now fixed.
	* Outfile must now be explicitly set to "-" for sadc to use the
	  standard system activity file.
	* FAQ updated.
	* iostat manual page updated. Typo fixed in sadc manual page.
	* Fixed the "Save picture" option of isag script.

2004/04/07: Version 5.0.3 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	* iostat now reads the number of sectors in /proc/diskstats or
	  from sysfs as 64-bit unsigned values.
	* iostat and mpstat now read CPU data and the number of
	  interrupts in /proc/stat as 64-bit unsigned values.
	* sar uses "%u" instead of "%d" to read unsigned integer
	  values _everywhere_.
	* sar and sadc are now a little bit more verbose when dealing
	  with invalid activity files.
	* Network interface name size is now read from include file
	  <net/if.h>.
	* FAQ polished up.
	* Slovak translation added. NLS updated.
	* Typo fixed in iostat manual page.
	* Makefile and CREDITS file updated.
	* isag upgraded to version 1.26 (isag package release 0.81.0).

2004/03/10: Version 5.0.2 - Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)
	* iostat will _again_ look for statistics in /proc/partitions if
	  available. Too many production servers are still using 2.2.x or
	  2.4.x kernels and iostat must be able to display extended stats
	  also for them (/proc/partitions support was removed in sysstat
	  version 4.1.3). So now, iostat gets its statistics from the
	  following sources in that order: /proc/diskstats, sysfs,
	  /proc/partitions and then /proc/stat.
	* statistics are now read by iostat and mpstat as unsigned long
	  instead of int to avoid integer overflow.
	* iostat should now handle properly the case when the 'weighted
	  number of milliseconds spent doing I/Os' (read in sysfs or
	  /proc/{partitions,diskstats}) decreases with time.
	* iostat manual page updated.
	* Minor temporary file vulnerability fixed in isag command.
	* README, FAQ and CREDITS files updated.
	* Author's email changed.

2004/02/02: Version 5.0.1 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* -L option added to sadc. Enable sadc to lock its output file
	  to prevent multiple instances from writing to it at once.
	* sa1 and sysstat scripts updated to take advantage of -L option.
	* Handle the case where, under very special circumstances, STDOUT
	  may become unavailable, and sar, iostat and mpstat are no longer
	  able to display anything.
	* sadc as called in sysstat script also uses -F option to force
	  the creation of daily data file.
	* sar, sadc and mpstat manual pages updated.
	* Code cleaned.
	* FAQ and CREDITS files updated.

2003/11/09: Version 5.0.0 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* New fields added to mpstat: %irq (%time spent servicing
	  interrupts) and %soft (%time spent servicing softirqs).
	* sar and iostat updated to take into account time spent servicing
	  interrupts and softirqs when displaying percentage of time
	  in system mode.
	* By default iostat now displays only statistics information for
	  devices that are used by the system. You should now use the ALL
	  keyword to tell iostat to display statistics for every device
	  including those that have never been used.
	* The file version.h is now dynamically created. sysstat's version
	  number is now only recorded in the Makefile.
	* sar manual page updated: beginning with kernels 2.4 and later,
	  pgpgin and pgpgout statistics are in kilobytes and not in
	  blocks (see linux-2.4/fs/proc/proc_misc.c and
	  linux-2.6/mm/page_alloc.c).
	* iostat and mpstat manual pages updated.
	* Makefile updated: don't process NLS files if they are up-to-date.
	* sysstat's RPM spec file updated to enable clean, non-root builds.
	* NLS updated.
	* FAQ and CREDITS files updated.

2003/09/28: Version 4.1.7 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! [0x2163]
	* /proc/diskstats is now the preferred source for iostat to get its
	  statistics. If non-existent, iostat falls back on sysfs then
	  on /proc/stat.
	* In addition to devices, partitions can also be entered on the
	  command line for iostat providing that option -x is not used.
	* /dev prefix has been removed from device name displayed by iostat -x.
	* sar -d now looks for disks statistics in /proc/diskstats with
	  post 2.5 kernels.
	* sar uses /proc/vmstat file with post 2.5 kernels to find paging
	  and swapping statistics.
	* activepg, inadtypg, inaclnpg and inatarpg stats removed from
	  sar -B report (they were not really useful).
	* sar -B now displays the number of page faults made by the system
	  (pgfault/s and pgmajflt/s).
	* Stat on shared memory removed from sar -r and sar -R (this stat
	  was no longer maintained by the kernel since 2.4 because of
	  performance problems).
	* Cached swap statistic information added to sar -r.
	* sar -d now displays separate statistics for sectors that are
	  read from or written to devices.
	* %file-sz (percentage of used file handles) is no longer displayed
	  by sar -v, since the upper limit for the number of open files
	  will self-scale with 2.6 kernels.
	* sar now looks more aggressively for network devices in /proc/net/dev.
	* Heading spaces in network interface names removed (sar -n).
	* Fixed a problem reading /proc/interrupts when there are a lot
	  of CPUs (mpstat, sadc).
	* NR_IRQS value increased to 256, since IA64 supports 256 irqs
	  per CPU.
	* Some stats counters are now read as unsigned long instead of
	  unsigned int (pgpgin, pgpgout, pswpin, pswpout, irq_sum).
	* sar and iostat manual pages updated.
	* FAQ, README and CREDITS files updated.
	* NLS updated.

2003/08/20: Version 4.1.6 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! [0x2162]
	* Machine uptime calculation is now optimized on SMP machines
	  to minimize the consequences if an overflow condition happens.
	  Especially useful when asking for stats since system boot.
	* -F option added to sadc. Useful to force the creation of the
	  daily data file: an already existing file with a wrong format
	  will be truncated by sadc if this option is used.
	* sa1 script now calls sadc with -F option.
	* The processor number to which the process is attached was no
	  longer displayed by sar -x. Make it appear again.
	* CPU usage for processes, as displayed by sar -x and sar -X, should
	  now be correct on machines where HZ <> 100 (e.g. IA64 architecture).
	* iostat still assumed that jiffies were 100ths of a second in some
	  places. Now use Linux HZ definition *everywhere*.
	* The average I/O requests queue length as displayed by iostat -x was
	  wrongly calculated. This is now fixed.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* NLS updated.
	* Cosmetic changes in various parts of the code.
	* FAQ, README and CREDITS files updated.

2003/07/21: Version 4.1.5 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! Delete existing data files
	  in /var/log/sa directory! [0x2161]
	* 'sar -x <pid>' and 'sar -X <pid>' work again.
	* sar had a longstanding bug that prevented option -P from
	  working properly if the machine had more than 32 processors.
	  This is now fixed.
	* Fixed a bug introduced in 4.1.2, which made some LINUX RESTART
	  messages to not be displayed by sar.
	* sar now uses bitmap of char instead of int to avoid endianness
	  problems.
	* sar can now handle a huge number of processors, serial lines and
	  network interfaces.
	* FAQ updated.

2003/07/01: Version 4.1.4 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! Delete existing data files
	  in /var/log/sa directory! [0x2160]
	* Fixed the way overflow conditions were handled by sar for
	  interfaces counters.
	* On really big machines with 100 GB of memory or more, the values
	  read by sadc in /proc/meminfo would get truncated and cause havoc
	  in the calculations. This is now fixed.
	* iostat and sar can now read many more disk entries in /proc/stat if
	  necessary.
	* Option "-x SUM" removed for sar. It was used to tell sar to display
	  the total number of minor and major faults made by the system.
	  Unfortunately, the calculation was tricky, and the results were
	  uncertain...
	* NLS updated. Polish translation added. Also proper charset and
	  encoding declarations added to fix msgfmt warnings and allow
	  gettext to recode between various charsets (e.g. German
	  translation will be shown properly both with
	  LANG=de_DE.ISO-8859-1, and LANG=de_DE.UTF-8)
	* Code 'sanitization'.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* README and FAQ files updated.

2003/05/08: Version 4.1.3 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* iostat should now be fully 2.5/2.6 kernel compliant.
	* Disks arrays in iostat are now dynamically sized.
	* iostat: sysfs is now used in preference to /proc/stat if available.
	* iostat will no longer look for statistics in /proc/partitions.
	  sysfs filesystem must now be available for iostat to get its
	  extended stats (post 2.5 kernels).
	* iostat: Devices for which statistics are requested can now be entered
	  on the command line even if option -x is not used.
	* Usage messages updated.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* Code cleaned (dk_drive_sum removed in iostat, long lines folded,
	  functions split in smaller parts, etc.)
	* NLS updated. Romanian translation added.
	* isag upgraded to version 1.22.

2003/01/24: Version 4.1.2 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one! Delete existing data files
	  in /var/log/sa directory! [0x215f]
	* sar -q now also displays load average for the past 15 minutes.
	* -P option added to sar. This option enables sar to display
	  stats on a per processor basis. Options -U and '-I PROC' are
	  deprecated. 'sar -U ALL' is replaced by 'sar -u -P ALL', and
	  'sar -I PROC' by 'sar -I SUM -P ALL'.
	* Fixed iowait value displayed by sar on SMP machines with pre 2.5
	  kernels.
	* When displaying CPU utilization on SMP machines, sar now
	  recalculates the interval based on current CPU's tick count.
	* Always check that the number of CPUs has not increased when
	  reading /proc/stat (sadc, mpstat).
	* sadc: Don't assume that the first line in /proc/net/sockstat
	  concerns sockets. Check it!
	* Serial lines are ignored by sadc for every kind of kernels
	  (UP, SMP...) if SMP_RACE is defined.
	  SMP_RACE is no longer defined by default in RPM packages.
	* Code cleaned: Dead code removed in iostat.c, some lines longer
	  than 80 chars folded, etc.
	* sar manual page updated.
	* FAQ updated.
	* NLS updated.

2003/01/02: Version 4.1.1 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>

	  compatible with the previous one! Delete existing data files
	  in /var/log/sa directory! [0x215e]
	* sar -u/-U, iostat and mpstat can now display time spent in
	  I/O wait mode (with 2.5 kernels and above).
	* Values like -1 and -2 are no longer aliases for keywords
	  ALL and XALL (sar -U, sar -I, mpstat -P).
	* Buglet fixed in iostat.h.
	* LC_CTYPE needs to be set, or it will emit messages with ?????? only
	  on some locales, especially ja_JP.eucJP
	* sar, mpstat and iostat manual pages updated.
	* NLS updated.
	* CREDITS file updated.
	* Typo removed in FAQ file.

2002/11/13: Version 4.0.7 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* Make data for timestamp 00:00:00 appear in one of the daily data
	  files when sar/sadc rotates its output file.
	* Take out check for non SMP configuration when asking for
	  mpstat -P.
	* sargon script updated.
	* FAQ updated.

2002/08/04: Version 4.0.6 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* mpstat now uses a bitmap of char instead of int to avoid endianness
	  problems. As a consequence, mpstat should now work on PowerMac
	  architectures.
	* CPU activity as displayed by mpstat -P for a given processor was
	  in a wrong range on SMP machines (e.g. 0-50% for a dual processor
	  box).
	* Missing bitmap initialization fixed in mpstat.c.
	* Configuration script updated.
	* FAQ updated.

2002/05/12: Version 4.0.5 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* Average wait times and service times as displayed by iostat -x
	  were wrong by a factor of 10. This is now fixed.
	* Linux RESTART messages must now be in the interval specified by
	  -s/-e options to be displayed by sar.
	* Fixed a small bug that affected the timestamp for RESTART messages

	  may overflow ULONG_MAX.
	* 'sar -d' now displays sectors per second instead of blocks
	  per second.
	* iostat and sar manual pages updated.
	* Added a FAQ.
	* NLS updated: Russian translation added.

2002/01/27: Version 4.0.3 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* iostat now displays statistics in kB/s when option -x is used.
	* Configuration script updated.
	* sar and iostat manual pages updated.
	* umask also set in sa1 shell script.
	* Various sanity checks added.
	* Fixed potential segmentation faults that could happen with some
	  locales.

2001/09/22: Version 4.0.2 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* CPU usage, as displayed by iostat, mpstat and sar, should now
	  be OK on machines where HZ <> 100 (e.g. IA64 architecture).
	* MAX_PART constant set to 256 in iostat.h.

	  in /var/log/sa directory! [0x215d]
	* New paging statistics added (sar -B). Kernel 2.4 only.
	* Load averages and queue length statistics added (option -q for sar).
	* Per device statistics added (option -d for sar). Kernel 2.4 only.
	* Better accuracy when computing average for some statistics.
	* Display all the contents of a daily data file when the count
	  parameter is not given on the command line.
	* Check sar command line options more aggressively.
	* iostat no longer freezes if -c and -d options are used together.
	* Fixed a bug that prevented iostat from displaying more than an

	* sar manual page updated.
	* NLS updated.
	* Code cleaned (use smaller subroutines).
	* Makefile updated.
	* isag command updates.

2001/02/11: Version 3.3.5 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* iostat command improved. Take now full advantage of Stephen
	  Tweedie's I/O accounting patch to display extended statistics
	  (option -x).
	* The default value for the count parameter of the sar command is
	  now 1 (this is how sar works with other Un*xes...). A value of
	  0 will indicate that reports are to be generated continuously.
	* Code cleaned: Now always use 'double' numbers instead of the
	  INT_PART, INT_VAL, DEC_PART and DEC_VAL macros.
	* Don't assume that jiffies are 100ths of a second. Use Linux
	  HZ definition instead.
	* NLS updated (small fix).

	* isag (Interactive System Activity Graph) command added.
	* Makefile updated.

2001/01/26: Version 3.3.4 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* Disk I/O statistics for the last device were counted twice when
	  reading /proc/stat file with 2.4 kernels (sar -b). This is now
	  fixed.
	* iostat command is no longer able to save its data to a file.
	  In fact, iostat has never been supposed to work that way, and I
	  have never really maintained this option.
	* iostat now also works with 2.4 kernels. It can handle the format
	  of the /proc/stat file for both 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.
	* sar now reports statistics on allocated disk quotas entries
	  instead of on used ones (sar -v).
	* Manual pages updated for sar and iostat.

2000/12/31: Version 3.3.3 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*

	* Disk usage displayed by iostat on SMP machines was wrong. This
	  is now fixed.
	* iostat command cleaned: All the statistics not implemented in
	  the standard Linux kernel have been removed (tty, iowait...).
	* sar can now handle I/O and transfer rate statistics with both
	  2.2.x and 2.4.x Linux kernels (-b option).
	* Removed %inode-sz that was displayed by sar -v, since the file
	  inode-max in /proc/sys/fs no longer exists in Linux 2.4.
	  The new 2.4.x kernels now seem to be able to allocate inode
	  structures dynamically, and to free them when necessary (see
	  linux/fs/inode.c).
	* Removed statistics on highest in-used sockets. Relevant
	  counters have disappeared from sockstat file in /proc/net
	  for 2.4 kernels (sar -n SOCK).
	* Added statistics on IP datagram fragments (sar -n SOCK).
	  Only available for 2.4 kernels.

2000/11/19: Version 3.3.2 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>

	  and in the user's timezone formats.
	  WARNING: Daily data files format has changed, and is *not*
	  compatible with the previous one!
	* sar now displays timestamps in locale time when reading data
	  from its daily data files. -t option has been added to sar,
	  to enable it to display timestamps in the original locale
	  time of the data file creator.
	* Size of various buffers made larger.
	* Number of interrupts per second for 'all' CPU displayed by the
	  mpstat command was wrong. This is now fixed.

	* Option -h added, enabling sar to display data from a daily data
	  file in a format that can easily be handled with pattern
	  processing commands like awk.
	* Manual page updated for sar.
	* iostat now writes KB (for kilobytes) instead of Kb, which could
	  have been interpreted as kilobits...
	* Disk accounting patch for iostat removed.
	* NLS updated.

2000/08/06: Version 3.2.4 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* Fixed a bug that prevented sar from reading its daily data files
	  when they had been created using -I option.

	* iostat disk accounting patch modified to work with md drivers.

2000/01/30: Version 3.0 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* sadc - system activity data collector added.
	* sa1, sa2 and sysstat.sh shell scripts added.
	* Manual pages added for sadc, sa1, sa2.
	* sar heavily modified to use stats sent by sadc.
	* System activity data file now records system restarts.
	* Every records in the iostat and system activity data files have
	  their own timestamp now.
	* sar and iostat largely modified to use structures when reading or
	  writing data files.
	* Per-process statistics added.
	* System minor and major fault statistics added.
	* TTY device statistics added.
	* Memory and swap space utilization statistics added.
	* Per-processor interrupt statistics added.
	* Statistics for kernel parameters (dcache, inodes, superblocks, etc.) 
	  added.
	* Network device statistics added.
	* S_TIME_FORMAT environment variable added.
	* Meaning of -i option has changed for sar.
	* -d option removed for sar since it is no longer needed (we have
	  sadc now).
	* sar now uses keywords such as ALL, SUM, etc. instead of numerical
	  parameters.
	* iostat disk accounting patch improved.
	* 'page' field in /proc/stat is no longer used by iostat (was
	  unreliable).
	* Workaround for buggy RTC (or kernels?) added. Used when the number
	  of jiffies spent by the system in the idle task is decreasing in
	  /proc/stat.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* NLS updated: Portuguese translation added.
	* Makefile updated.

1999/11/28: Version 2.2 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* Option -d added to sar to enable it to be started as a daemon.
	* sar initialization script updated to use -d option.
	* Option -V added to sar and iostat (print version number and usage).
	* Fixed a bug that made CPU utilization displayed by iostat wrong on
	  SMP machines.
	* Manual pages updated and moved to chapter 1 instead of 8.
	* sar '-m' option renamed to '-r'.
	* Display improved for iostat.
	* NLS updated: Spanish translation added.
	* Patch against kernel 2.2.13 added for iostat.

1999/10/24: Version 2.1 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* The sar and iostat commands can now work on non SMP-machines even
	  if the kernel is compiled with SMP support enabled.
	* Fixed a bug that made the time displayed by iostat wrong when
	  reading stats back from a file.
	* Added memory statistics: free/shared/buffer/cached pages (sar -m).
	* Option -h added to sar to print its header periodically.
	* Set unavailable fields to zero when writing iostat file.
	* sar now displays 'proc/s' instead of 'fork/s' since exec'ed
	  processes are also taken into account.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* sysstat is now available in RPM format.
	* Code cleaned up and made safer.

1999/09/19: Version 2.0 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* iostat now displays logical block I/O stats for each IDE device, or
	  global Kb/s rate for all the block devices. Stats in Kb/s for each
	  block device are not available for standard kernels due to Linux
	  poor disk accounting... Anyway a patch is provided in this version
	  of 'sysstat' in the 'patch' directory to fix that.
	* System uptime is no longer read in /proc/uptime but computed from
	  the cpu line in /proc/stat.
	* When stats are read from a file (option -f of iostat and sar),
	  values are now computed in accordance with the interval given by
	  the user on the command line.
	* Old '-o' option for iostat removed. Now iostat can save data
	  into a file in a binary format and re-read them later (options
	  '-o' and '-f') in the same way sar does.
	* Number of available processors now taken into account when
	  retrieving CPU usage from /proc/stat.
	* Removed a bug that prevented 'sar -U' to work on SMP machines.
	* Fixed a bug that made per-CPU average usage wrong on SMP machines.
	* Use of option -U is now possible for sar when reading from a file
	  even if the machine is not an SMP one.
	* Fixed a bug that prevented sar from re-reading stats saved in a file
	  when -I or -U option had been used.
	* iostat modified to work on SMP machines.
	* Changed the formula used to display stats in order not to get
	  numbers greater than UINT_MAX.
	* System name, release number and hostname are now saved in 
	  system activity files.
	* iostat now displays system name, release number and hostname
	  when invoked.
	* Daily system activity file rotation added for sar.
	* Improved 64-bit system support.
	* CREDITS file added.
	* NLS updated: German translation added.
	* Manual pages updated.
	* Makefile updated: Do not call msgfmt if NLS is not enabled.

1999/06/25: Version 1.2 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* Better NLS support (date, time and numerical values, NLS enabled
	  for sar, etc.).
	* System activity daily file structure changed: Is now independent of
	  the locale and is more compact.
	* sar updated to support SMP machines (per CPU accounting).
	* Code cleaned, man pages updated...

1999/05/28: Version 1.1 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr>
	* NLS support added. French translation started but needs to be
	  completed.
	* sar updated to support more than 16 interrupts (potential APIC
	  interrupt sources).
	* A few typos removed (man pages, etc.).
	* Author email address updated :-)
	* Tested on kernel 2.2.5.

1999/03/06: Version 1.0 - Sebastien Godard <sebastien.godard@gazdefrance.com>
	* Initial Revision. Tested on kernel 2.0.36.
