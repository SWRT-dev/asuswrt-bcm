  * Updated translations: cs, de, en_CA, nl, pl, sk, sv, vi

  * Added remaining GPS tags from the EXIF 2.2 spec to the tag table

    (to match the EXIF 2.2 spec) which stops them from being erroneously

  * Changed exif_tag_get_support_level_in_ifd() to return a value when possible
    when the data type for the given EXIF data is unknown. This will cause

    data type being set.
