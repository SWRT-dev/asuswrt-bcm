5. TERM AND TERMINATION

(a) General.  This Agreement and the license(s) granted herein will remain effective until terminated.  Licensee may terminate this Agreement and the license(s) granted herein by ceasing use of the SOFTWARE and the Documentation.  The license(s) granted to Licensee under this Agreement will also automatically terminate if Licensee fails to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.

6. LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

(a) Limited Warranty.  If Licensee licenses IxChariot "Console" software from Ixia and that software is covered by Ixia's limited warranty, then the SOFTWARE and the Documentation shall also be covered by that limited warranty (as if the SOFTWARE and the Documentation constitute such IxChariot "Console" software and its related documentation), but only until such time as that limited warranty is no longer effective with respect to such IxChariot "Console" software. 

(b) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 6(a) ABOVE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,  THE SOFTWARE AND THE DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", AND IXIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS DO NOT MAKE AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF EVERY KIND RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION, AND/OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTUAL AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT), AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES THAT THE SOFTWARE (OR ANY ELEMENTS THEREOF) WILL ACHIEVE A PARTICULAR RESULT, OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

(b) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL IXIA, ITS SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, OR FROM INTERRUPTED COMMUNICATIONS OR DAMAGED DATA, OR FROM ANY DEFECT OR ERROR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH LICENSEE'S ACQUISITION OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES OR MALFUNCTION OF THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARISING FROM BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY OR FROM NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION, AND/OR ANY USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF IXIA OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS BEEN ADVISED OR SHOULD KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IXIA'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION, AND/OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ANY LICENSE FEES AND/OR MAINTENANCE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE IXCHARIOT "CONSOLE" SOFTWARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE.

(c) ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS BY AGENTS, LICENSEES, EMPLOYEES, RESELLERS, OR DISTRIBUTORS OF IXIA DO NOT CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES BY IXIA, DO NOT BIND IXIA, AND MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON.

(d) Responsibilities of Licensee.  As a licensee of the SOFTWARE, Licensee is solely responsible for the proper installation and operation of the SOFTWARE in accordance with the instructions and specifications set forth in the Documentation.  Ixia and its distributors shall have no responsibility or liability to Licensee for improper installation or operation of the SOFTWARE.  

(e)  FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 6 WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY TO ACHIEVE ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  

(f)  STATE LAW RIGHTS.  LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH MAY VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.  BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, OR LIMITATIONS ON OR EXCLUSIONS OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE DEPENDING ON ITS STATE OF RESIDENCE.  LICENSEE SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING SUCH RIGHTS.

7. INDEMNITY

Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Ixia and its distributors from and against any and all claims, losses, or damages (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees) attributable to (a) Licensee's use or misuse of the SOFTWARE or the Documentation, or (b) any failure by Licensee to comply with any term, condition, or restriction in this Agreement.

8. NON-DISCLOSURE

Licensee shall take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the SOFTWARE and the Documentation, or any portion thereof, is not made available or disclosed by Licensee (or by any of its employees, representatives, or agents) to any person other than as may be necessary to Licensee's employees, representatives, and agents to use the same as expressly permitted herein.  Licensee agrees that all of its employees, representatives, and agents having access to the SOFTWARE or the Documentation shall observe and perform the terms of this Section.

9. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS

(a) Commercial Software.  The SOFTWARE and its accompanying Documentation are deemed to be "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", respectively, for purposes of Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR") 12.212 and the Defense FAR Supplement ("DFARS") 227.7202-1, 227.7202-3, and 227.7202-4, and the restrictions set forth in such regulations, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be the license described in such regulations.  Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the SOFTWARE or its accompanying Documentation by any agency, department, or entity of the United States Government (the "Government") shall be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.  The SOFTWARE and its accompanying Documentation are also deemed to be "restricted computer software" for purposes of  FAR 52.227-14(g)(3) (Alternate III (June 1987)) and FAR 52.227-19, which clauses are incorporated herein by reference subject to the express restrictions and prohibitions set forth above.

(b) Certain Technical Data.  Any technical data provided that is not covered by the above provisions is deemed to be "technical information related to commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation" for purposes of FAR 12.212 and the restrictions set forth therein, and is deemed to be "technical data or information related or pertaining to commercial items or processes" developed at private expense for purposes of DFARS 227.7102-1 and 227.7102-2 and the restrictions set forth therein, and this Agreement shall be deemed to be the license described in such regulations.  Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such technical data by the Government shall be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.  Such technical data is also deemed to be "limited rights data" as defined in FAR 52.227-14(a) (Alternate I (June 1987)) and for purposes of FAR 52.227-14(g)(2) (Alternate II (June 1987)), which clauses are incorporated herein by reference subject to the express restrictions and prohibitions set forth above.  Such technical data shall also be deemed to be "technical data" for purposes of DFARS 252.227-7015, which clause is incorporated herein by reference subject to the express restrictions and prohibitions set forth above.

(c) Third-Party Acceptance of Restrictions.  Licensee shall not provide the SOFTWARE, its accompanying Documentation, or the technical data to any party, including the Government, unless such third party accepts the same restrictions as are set forth in this Section 9.  Licensee is responsible for ensuring that the proper notice is given to all such third parties and that the SOFTWARE, its accompanying Documentation, and the technical data are properly marked with the required legends.  Nothing in this Section 9(c) shall be deemed to modify the restrictions on transfer set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

10. GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without reference to conflicts of laws principles provided, however, that if the Software was acquired outside the United States, then certain local laws may apply. The parties agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Los Angeles County, California in connection with the litigation of any dispute under this Agreement and waive any objection to such jurisdiction based on venue or personal jurisdiction.  In addition, this Agreement will not be governed or interpreted in any way by referring to any law based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), even if that law has been adopted in California, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby excluded.

11. MISCELLANEOUS

This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Ixia and Licensee with respect to the SOFTWARE, the Documentation, and Licensee's use of the Software and the Documentation, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement regarding the subject matter hereof.  No provision of this Agreement may be waived, modified, or superseded except by a written instrument signed by each of Ixia and Licensee.  Any suppliers, licensors, and distributors of Ixia shall be direct and intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, including without limitation the disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability set forth herein.  No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver of any such (or any other) right or remedy.  The language of this Agreement shall be construed as a whole, according to its fair meaning and intent, and not strictly for or against either party, regardless of who drafted or was principally responsible for drafting this Agreement or any specific term or conditions hereof.  This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.  Both parties are acting as independent contractors with respect to the activities hereunder.  In the event of any legal proceeding between the parties arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any other relief awarded or granted, its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and expert witness' fees) incurred in any such proceeding.  If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be construed, limited, or altered, as necessary, to eliminate the invalidity or unenforceability and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 
3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
3.3. Description of Modifications. 
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
(a) Third Party Claims. 
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
(b) Contributor APIs. 
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
5. Application of this License. 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code. 
6. Versions of the License. 
6.1. New Versions. 
Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 
6.2. Effect of New Versions. 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
6.3. Derivative Works. 
If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.) 
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 
8. TERMINATION. 
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 
11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.
