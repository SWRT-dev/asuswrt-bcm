This test is identical to eapsim-05, but uses triplets that come from
the file simtriplets.dat.

To configure this test, add the following to radiusd.conf:

In modules {},

   sim_files {
	     simtriplets = "/some/file"
   }

   (The default is to use ${raddbdir}/simtriplets.dat )

In authorized {}, add:

   sim_files 

before eap.

Of course, you'll already have "sim" listed in the eap{} section of
modules.
