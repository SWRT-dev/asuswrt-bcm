Compiling FreeRADIUS under OS/2

To compile FreeRADIUS unde OS/2 you must have a full EMX environment with GNU
utilities (like make,sh)

The EMX can be get from http://hobbes.nmsu.edu

To work with CVS repository you must install cvs110.zip from hobbes also

before entering in sh.exe you must do
SET SHELL=sh.exe

before running ./configure you must set the shell the variables :
export CC=gcc
export MAKE=fullpathofyourmake.exe
export PERL=fullpathofyourperl.exe


The OS/2 version of FreeRADIUS can't directly execute checkrad.pl then the
program will execute a checkrad.cmd
