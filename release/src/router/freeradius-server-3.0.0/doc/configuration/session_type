Session-Type is used to select between groupings of
modules in the session stanza using arbitrary attributes.
It is functionally identical to Acct-Type, apart from
the name of the attribute. This means that (unlike
Autz-Type) the attribute must be set before the stanza
is run. Changes to Session-Type during session will
have no effect.

This allows Simultaneous-Use checking behaviour to be very flexible.
