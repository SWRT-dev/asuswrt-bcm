Abstract

   This document describes the IANA considerations for the Remote
   Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).

   This document updates RFC 2865.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS), defined in
   [RFC2865], in accordance with BCP 26, [RFC2434].  It also reserves
   Packet Type Codes that are or have been in use on the Internet.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

RFC 3575             IANA Considerations for RADIUS            July 2003


1.2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used here with the meanings defined in BCP
   26:  "name space", "assigned value", "registration".

   The following policies are used here with the meanings defined in BCP
   26: "Private Use", "First Come First Served", "Expert Review",
   "Specification Required", "IESG Approval", "IETF Consensus",
   "Standards Action".

2.  IANA Considerations

   There are three name spaces in RADIUS that require registration:
   Packet Type Codes, Attribute Types, and Attribute Values (for certain
   Attributes).  This document creates no new IANA registries, since a
   RADIUS registry was created by [RFC2865].

   RADIUS is not intended as a general-purpose protocol, and allocations
   SHOULD NOT be made for purposes unrelated to Authentication,
   Authorization or Accounting.

2.1.  Recommended Registration Policies

   For registration requests where a Designated Expert should be
   consulted, the responsible IESG area director should appoint the
   Designated Expert.  The intention is that any allocation will be
   accompanied by a published RFC.  However, the Designated Expert can
   approve allocations once it seems clear that an RFC will be
   published, allowing for the allocation of values prior to the
   document being approved for publication as an RFC.  The Designated
   Expert will post a request to the AAA WG mailing list (or a successor
   designated by the Area Director) for comment and review, including an
   Internet-Draft.  Before a period of 30 days has passed, the
   Designated Expert will either approve or deny the registration
   request, publish a notice of the decision to the AAA WG mailing list
   or its successor, and inform IANA of its decision.  A denial notice
   must be justified by an explanation and, in the cases where it is
   possible, concrete suggestions on how the request can be modified so
   as to become acceptable.

   Packet Type Codes have a range from 1 to 253.  RADIUS Type Codes 1-5
   and 11-13 were allocated in [RFC2865], while Type Codes 40-45,
   250-253 are allocated by this document.  Type Codes 250-253 are
   allocated for Experimental Uses, and 254-255 are reserved.  Packet
   Type Codes 6-10, 12-13, 21-34, 50-51 have no meaning defined by an
   IETF RFC, but are reserved until a specification is provided for
   them.  This is being done to avoid interoperability problems with
   software that implements non-standard RADIUS extensions that are or

   have been in use on the Internet.  Because a new Packet Type has
   considerable impact on interoperability, a new Packet Type Code
   requires IESG Approval.  The intention is that any allocation will be
   accompanied by a published RFC.  Type Codes 52-249 should be
   allocated first; when these are exhausted, Type Codes 14-20, 35-39,
   46-49 may be allocated.  For a list of Type Codes, see Appendix A.

   Attribute Types have a range from 1 to 255, and are the scarcest
   resource in RADIUS, thus must be allocated with care.  Attributes
   1-53,55,60-88,90-91,94-100 have been allocated, with 17 and 21
   available for re-use.  Attributes 17, 21, 54, 56-59, 89, 101-191 may
   be allocated by IETF Consensus.  It is recommended that attributes 17
   and 21 be used only after all others are exhausted.

   Note that RADIUS defines a mechanism for Vendor-Specific extensions
   (Attribute 26) for functions specific only to one vendor's
   implementation of RADIUS, where no interoperability is deemed useful.
   For functions specific only to one vendor's implementation of RADIUS,
   the use of that should be encouraged instead of the allocation of
   global attribute types.

   As noted in [RFC2865]:

      Attribute Type Values 192-223 are reserved for experimental use,
      values 224-240 are reserved for implementation-specific use, and
      values 241-255 are reserved and should not be used.

   Therefore Attribute Type values 192-240 are considered Private Use,
   and values 241-255 require Standards Action.

   Certain attributes (for example, NAS-Port-Type) in RADIUS define a
   list of values to correspond with various meanings.  There can be 4
   billion (2^32) values for each attribute.  Additional values can be
   allocated by the Designated Expert.  The exception to this policy is
   the Service-Type attribute (6), whose values define new modes of
   operation for RADIUS.  Values 1-16 of the Service-Type attribute have
   been allocated.  Allocation of new Service-Type values are by IETF
   Consensus.  The intention is that any allocation will be accompanied
   by a published RFC.

Appendix A - RADIUS Packet Types

   A list of RADIUS Packet Type Codes is given below.  This document
   instructs IANA to list them in the registry of Packet Type Codes.
   Note that Type Codes 40-45, defined in [DynAuth], are being formally
   allocated here.  Codes 40-45 were listed in [RFC2882] and have been
   implemented and used.  Given their current widespread usage, these
   assignments are not reclaimable in practice.
