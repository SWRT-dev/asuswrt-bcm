               RADIUS Attributes for IPv6 Access Networks

Abstract

   This document specifies additional IPv6 RADIUS Attributes useful in
   residential broadband network deployments.  The Attributes, which are
   used for authorization and accounting, enable assignment of a host
   IPv6 address and an IPv6 DNS server address via DHCPv6, assignment of
   an IPv6 route announced via router advertisement, assignment of a
   named IPv6 delegated prefix pool, and assignment of a named IPv6 pool
   for host DHCPv6 addressing.

RFC 6911                   RADIUS IPv6 Access                 April 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies additional RADIUS Attributes used to support
   configuration of DHCPv6 and/or ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
   parameters on a per-user basis.  The Attributes, which complement
   those defined in [RFC3162] and [RFC4818], support the following:

   o  The assignment of specific IPv6 addresses to hosts via DHCPv6.

   o  The assignment of an IPv6 DNS server address, via DHCPv6 or Router
      Advertisement [RFC6106].

   o  The configuration of more specific routes to be announced to the
      user via the Route Information Option defined in [RFC4191],
      Section 2.3.

   o  The assignment of a named delegated prefix pool for use with "IPv6
      Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      version 6" [RFC3633].

   o  The assignment of a named stateful address pool for use with
      DHCPv6 stateful address assignment [RFC3315].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Deployment Scenarios

   The extensions in this document are intended to be applicable across
   a wide variety of network access scenarios in which RADIUS is
   involved.  One such typical network scenario is illustrated in Figure
   1.  It is composed of an IP Routing Residential Gateway (RG) or host;
   a Layer 2 Access Node (AN), e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access
   Multiplexer (DSLAM); an IP Network Access Server (NAS) (incorporating
   an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) client); and a
   AAA server.

                                  Figure 1

   In the depicted scenario, the NAS may utilize an IP address
   configuration protocol (e.g., DHCPv6) to handle address assignment to
   RGs/hosts.  The RADIUS server authenticates each RG/host and returns
   the Attributes used for authorization and accounting.  These
   Attributes can include a host's IPv6 address, a DNS server address,
   and a set of IPv6 routes to be advertised via any suitable protocol,
   e.g., ICMPv6 (Neighbor Discovery).  The name of a prefix pool to be
   used for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation or the name of an address pool to
   be used for DHCPv6 address assignment can also be Attributes provided
   to the NAS by the RADIUS AAA server.

   The following subsections discuss how these Attributes are used in
   more detail.

2.1.  IPv6 Address Assignment

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  To provide a DHCPv6 server
   residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be assigned,
   this document specifies the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute
   (Section 3.1).

   While [RFC3162] permits the specification of an IPv6 address via the
   combination of the Framed-Interface-Id and Framed-IPv6-Prefix
   Attributes, this separation is more natural for use with PPP's IPv6
   Control Protocol than it is for use with DHCPv6, and the use of a
   single IPv6 address Attribute makes for easier processing of
   accounting records.

RFC 6911                   RADIUS IPv6 Access                 April 2013


   Because DHCPv6 can be deployed on the same network as ICMPv6
   stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862], it is possible
   that the NAS will require both stateful and stateless configuration
   information.  Therefore, it is possible for the Framed-IPv6-Address,
   Framed-IPv6-Prefix, and Framed-Interface-Id Attributes [RFC3162] to
   be included within the same packet.  To avoid ambiguity in this case,
   the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute is intended for authorization and
   accounting of DHCPv6-assigned addresses, and the Framed-IPv6-Prefix
   and Framed-Interface-Id Attributes are used for authorization and
   accounting of addresses assigned via SLAAC.

2.2.  DNS Servers

   DHCPv6 provides an option for configuring a host with the IPv6
   address of a DNS server.  The IPv6 address of a DNS server can also
   be conveyed to the host using ICMPv6 with Router Advertisements, via
   the Recursive DNS Server Option [RFC6106].  To provide the NAS with
   the IPv6 address of one or more DNS servers, this document specifies
   the DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute (Section 3.2).

2.3.  IPv6 Route Information

   The IPv6 Route Information Option [RFC4191], is intended to be used
   to inform a host connected to the NAS that a specific route is
   reachable via any given NAS.

   This document specifies the Route-IPv6-Information Attribute
   (Section 3.3) that allows the AAA server to provision the
   announcement by the NAS of a specific Route Information Option to an
   accessing host.  The NAS may advertise this route using the method
   defined in RFC 4191 or other equivalent methods.  Any other
   information, such as preference or lifetime values, that is to be
   present in the actual announcement using a given method is assumed to
   be determined by the NAS using means not specified by this document
   (e.g., local configuration on the NAS).

   While the Framed-IPv6-Prefix Attribute ([RFC3162], Section 2.3)
   allows the route to be advertised in an RA, it cannot be used to
   configure more specific routes.  While the Framed-IPv6-Route
   Attribute ([RFC3162], Section 2.5) causes the route to be configured
   on the NAS and potentially to be announced via an IP routing
   protocol, depending on the value of Framed-Routing, it does not
   result in the route being announced in an RA.

RFC 6911                   RADIUS IPv6 Access                 April 2013


2.4.  Delegated IPv6 Prefix Pool

   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633] involves a delegating
   router selecting a prefix and delegating it on a temporary basis to a
   requesting router.  The delegating router may implement a number of
   strategies as to how it chooses what prefix is to be delegated to a
   requesting router, one of them being the use of a local named prefix
   pool.  The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool Attribute (Section 3.4) allows
   the RADIUS server to convey a prefix pool name to a NAS that is
   hosting a DHCPv6-PD server and that is acting as a delegating router.

   Because DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation can be used with SLAAC on the same
   network, it is possible for the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool and
   Framed-IPv6-Pool Attributes to be included within the same packet.
   To avoid ambiguity in this scenario, use of the Delegated-IPv6-
   Prefix-Pool Attribute should be restricted to authorization and
   accounting of prefix pools used in DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, and the
   Framed-IPv6-Pool Attribute should be used for authorization and
   accounting of prefix pools used in SLAAC.

2.5.  Stateful IPv6 Address Pool

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides a mechanism to assign one or more non-
   temporary IPv6 addresses to hosts.  Section 3.1 introduces the
   Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute to be used to provide a DHCPv6 server
   residing on a NAS with one or more IPv6 addresses to be assigned to
   the clients.  An alternative way to achieve a similar result is for
   the NAS to select the IPv6 address to be assigned from an address
   pool configured for this purpose on the NAS.  This document specifies
   the Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool Attribute (Section 3.5) to allow the
   RADIUS server to convey a pool name to be used for such stateful
   DHCPv6-based addressing and for any subsequent accounting.

3.  Attributes

   The fields shown in the diagrams below are transmitted from left to
   right.

3.1.  Framed-IPv6-Address

   The Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute indicates an IPv6 address that is
   assigned to the NAS-facing interface of the RG/host.  It MAY be used
   in Access-Accept packets and MAY appear multiple times.  It MAY be
   used in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the RADIUS
   server that it would prefer this IPv6 address, but the RADIUS server
   is not required to honor the hint.  Because it is assumed that the

RFC 6911                   RADIUS IPv6 Access                 April 2013


   NAS will add a route corresponding to the address, it is not
   necessary for the RADIUS server to also send a host Framed-IPv6-Route
   Attribute for the same address.

   This Attribute can be used by a DHCPv6 process on the NAS to assign a
   unique IPv6 address to the RG/host.

   A summary of the Framed-IPv6-Address Attribute format is shown below.
   The format of the Address field is identical to that of the
   corresponding field in the NAS-IPv6-Address Attribute [RFC3162].

3.2.  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   The DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute contains the IPv6 address of a
   DNS server.  This Attribute MAY be included multiple times in Access-
   Accept packets when the intention is for a NAS to announce more than
   one DNS server address to an RG/host.  The Attribute MAY be used in
   an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the RADIUS server
   regarding the DNS IPv6 address, but the RADIUS server is not required
   to honor the hint.

   The content of this Attribute can be copied to an instance of the
   DHCPv6 DNS Recursive Name Server Option [RFC3646] or to an IPv6
   Router Advertisement Recursive DNS Server Option [RFC6106].  If more
   than one DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute is present in the Access-
   Accept packet, the addresses from the Attributes SHOULD be copied in
   the same order as received.

   A summary of the DNS-Server-IPv6-Address Attribute format is given
   below.  The format of the Address field is the same as that of the
   corresponding field in the NAS-IPv6-Address Attribute [RFC3162].

3.3.  Route-IPv6-Information

   The Route-IPv6-Information Attribute specifies a prefix (and
   corresponding route) for the user on the NAS, which is to be
   announced using the Route Information Option defined in "Default
   Router Preferences and More Specific Routes" [RFC4191], Section 2.3.
   It is used in the Access-Accept packet and can appear multiple times.
   It MAY be used in an Access-Request packet as a hint by the NAS to
   the RADIUS server, but the RADIUS server is not required to honor the
   hint.  The Route-IPv6-Information Attribute format is depicted below.
   The format of the prefix is as per [RFC3162].

      Variable-length field containing an IP prefix.  The prefix length
      field contains the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
      The bits in the prefix after the prefix length, if any, are
      reserved and MUST be initialized to zero.

RFC 6911                   RADIUS IPv6 Access                 April 2013


3.4.  Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool Attribute contains the name of an
   assigned pool that SHOULD be used to select an IPv6 delegated prefix
   for the user on the NAS.  If a NAS does not support prefix pools, the
   NAS MUST ignore this Attribute.  It MAY be used in an Access-Request
   packet as a hint by the NAS to the RADIUS server regarding the pool,
   but the RADIUS server is not required to honor the hint.

   A summary of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool Attribute format is shown
   below.

       0                   1                   2
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      171 for Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   Length

      Length, in bytes.  At least 3.

   String

      The string field contains the name of an assigned IPv6 prefix pool
      configured on the NAS.  The field is not NULL (hexadecimal 00)
      terminated.

   Note: The string data type is as documented in [RFC6158] and carries
   binary data that is external to the RADIUS protocol, e.g., the name
   of a pool of prefixes configured on the NAS.

3.5.  Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool

   The Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool Attribute contains the name of an
   assigned pool that SHOULD be used to select an IPv6 address for the
   user on the NAS.  If a NAS does not support address pools, the NAS
   MUST ignore this Attribute.  A summary of the Stateful-IPv6-Address-
   Pool Attribute format is shown below.  It MAY be used in an Access-
   Request packet as a hint by the NAS to the RADIUS server regarding
   the pool, but the RADIUS server is not required to honor the hint.

       0                   1                   2
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |     String...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      172 for Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool

   Length

      Length, in bytes.  At least 3.

   String

      The string field contains the name of an assigned IPv6 stateful
      address pool configured on the NAS.  The field is not NULL
      (hexadecimal 00) terminated.

   Note: The string data type is as documented in [RFC6158] and carries
   binary data that is external to the RADIUS protocol, e.g., the name
   of a pool of addresses configured on the NAS.

3.6.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide to which Attributes may be found
   in which kinds of packets, and in what quantity.  The optional
   inclusion of the options in Access Request messages is intended to
   allow for a NAS to provide the RADIUS server with a hint of the
   Attributes in advance of user authentication, which may be useful in
   cases in which a user reconnects or has a static address.  The server
   is under no obligation to honor such hints.

4.  Diameter Considerations

   Given that the Attributes defined in this document are allocated from
   the standard RADIUS type space (see Section 6), no special handling
   is required by Diameter entities.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies additional IPv6 RADIUS Attributes useful in
   residential broadband network deployments.  In such networks, the
   RADIUS protocol may run either over IPv4 or over IPv6, and known
   security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol, e.g., [SECI], apply
   to the Attributes defined in this document.  A trust relationship
   between a NAS and RADIUS server is expected to be in place, with
   communication optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [RFC6614].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned five new RADIUS Attribute types in the "Radius
   Attribute Types" registry (currently located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types) for the following
   Attributes:

   o  Framed-IPv6-Address

   o  DNS-Server-IPv6-Address

   o  Route-IPv6-Information

   o  Delegated-IPv6-Prefix-Pool

   o  Stateful-IPv6-Address-Pool
