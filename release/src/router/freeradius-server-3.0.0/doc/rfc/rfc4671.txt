Abstract

   This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS
   accounting server functions.  These extensions represent a portion of
   the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
   protocols in the Internet community.  Using these extensions,
   IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS accounting servers.

   This memo obsoletes RFC 2621 by deprecating the MIB table containing
   IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for
   version-neutral IP address formats.  The remaining MIB objects from
   RFC 2621 are carried forward into this document.  This memo also adds
   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.

RFC 4671             RADIUS Acct Server MIB (IPv6)           August 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   The objects defined within this memo relate to the Remote
   Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Accounting Server as
   defined in RFC 2866 [RFC2866].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2865 [RFC2865] and RFC 2866
   [RFC2866].

   This document uses the word "malformed" with respect to RADIUS
   packets, particularly in the context of counters of "malformed
   packets".  While RFC 2866 does not provide an explicit definition of
   "malformed", malformed generally means that the implementation has
   determined the packet does not match the format defined in RFC 2866.
   Those implementations are used in deployments today, and thus set the
   de facto definition of "malformed".

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Scope of Changes

   This document obsoletes RFC 2621 [RFC2621], RADIUS Accounting Server
   MIB, by deprecating the radiusAccClientTable table and adding a new
   table, radiusAccClientExtTable, containing
   radiusAccClientInetAddressType and radiusAccClientInetAddress.  The
   purpose of these added MIB objects is to support version-neutral IP
   addressing formats.  The existing table containing

   radiusAccClientAddress is deprecated.  The remaining MIB objects from
   RFC 2621 are carried forward into this document.  This memo also adds
   UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.

   RFC 4001 [RFC4001], which defines the SMI Textual Conventions for
   version-neutral IP addresses, contains the following recommendation.

   'In particular, when revising a MIB module that contains IPv4
   specific tables, it is suggested to define new tables using the
   textual conventions defined in this memo [RFC4001] that support all
   versions of IP.  The status of the new tables SHOULD be "current",
   whereas the status of the old IP version specific tables SHOULD be
   changed to "deprecated".  The other approach, of having multiple
   similar tables for different IP versions, is strongly discouraged.'

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The RADIUS accounting protocol, described in RFC 2866 [RFC2866],
   distinguishes between the client function and the server function.
   In RADIUS accounting, clients send Accounting-Requests, and servers
   reply with Accounting-Responses.  Typically, Network Access Server
   (NAS) devices implement the client function, and thus would be
   expected to implement the RADIUS accounting client MIB, while RADIUS
   accounting servers implement the server function, and thus would be
   expected to implement the RADIUS accounting server MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS accounting entity to perform
   both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS proxy may
   act as a server to one or more RADIUS accounting clients, while
   simultaneously acting as an accounting client to one or more
   accounting servers.  In such situations, it is expected that RADIUS
   entities combining client and server functionality will support both
   the client and server MIBs.  The server MIB is defined in this
   document, and the client MIB is defined in [RFC4670].

   This MIB module contains thirteen scalars as well as a single table,
   the RADIUS Accounting Client Table, which contains one row for each
   RADIUS accounting client with which the server shares a secret.  Each
   entry in the RADIUS Accounting Client Table includes twelve columns
   presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS accounting server.

   This MIB imports from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC3411], and [RFC4001].

6.  Deprecated Objects

   The deprecated table in this MIB is carried forward from RFC 2621
   [RFC2621].  There are two conditions under which it MAY be desirable
   for managed entities to continue to support the deprecated table:

   1.  The managed entity only supports IPv4 address formats.

   2.  The managed entity supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats,
       and the deprecated table is supported for backwards compatibility
       with older management stations.  This option SHOULD only be used
       when the IP addresses in the new table are in IPv4 format and can
       accurately be represented in both the new table and the
       deprecated table.

   Managed entities SHOULD NOT instantiate row entries in the deprecated
   table, containing IPv4-only address objects, when the RADIUS
   accounting client address represented in such a table row is not an
   IPv4 address.  Managed entities SHOULD NOT return inaccurate values
   of IP address or SNMP object access errors for IPv4-only address
   objects in otherwise populated tables.  When row entries exist in
   both the deprecated IPv4-only table and the new IP-version-neutral
   table that describe the same RADIUS accounting client, the row
   indexes SHOULD be the same for the corresponding rows in each table,
   to facilitate correlation of these related rows by management
   applications.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are management objects (radiusAccServConfigReset) defined in
   this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in
   some network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are:






Nelson                       Informational                     [Page 20]

RFC 4671             RADIUS Acct Server MIB (IPv6)           August 2006


   radiusAccServConfigReset
      This object can be used to reinitialize the persistent state of
      any server.  When set to reset(2), any persistent server state
      (such as a process) is reinitialized as if the server had just
      been started.  Depending on the server implementation details,
      this action may or may not interrupt the processing of pending
      request in the server.  Abuse of this object may lead to a Denial
      of Service attack on the server.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These are:

   radiusAccClientIPAddress
      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS accounting
      client with which the server is communicating.  This information
      could be useful in mounting an attack on the accounting client.

   radiusAccClientInetAddress
      This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS accounting
      client with which the server is communicating.  This information
      could be useful in mounting an attack on the accounting client.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
