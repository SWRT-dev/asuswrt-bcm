                    RADIUS Authentication Server MIB

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a set of extensions which instrument RADIUS
   authentication server functions. These extensions represent a portion
   of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  Using these
   extensions IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS
   authentication servers.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing RADIUS
   authentication servers.

   RADIUS authentication servers are today widely deployed by dialup
   Internet Service Providers, in order to provide authentication
   services.  As a result, the effective management of RADIUS
   authentication servers is of considerable importance.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
        2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC
        2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   The RADIUS authentication protocol, described in [16], distinguishes
   between the client function and the server function.  In RADIUS
   authentication, clients send Access-Requests, and servers reply with
   Access-Accepts, Access-Rejects, and Access-Challenges.  Typically NAS
   devices implement the client function, and thus would be expected to
   implement the RADIUS authentication client MIB, while RADIUS
   authentication servers implement the server function, and thus would
   be expected to implement the RADIUS authentication server MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS authentication entity to perform
   both client and server functions. For example, a RADIUS proxy may act
   as a server to one or more RADIUS authentication clients, while
   simultaneously acting as an authentication client to one or more
   authentication servers.  In such situations, it is expected that
   RADIUS entities combining client and server functionality will
   support both the client and server MIBs.

3.1.  Selected objects

   This MIB module contains fourteen scalars as well as a single table:

   (1)  the RADIUS Authentication Client Table contains one row for
        each RADIUS authentication client that the server shares a
        secret with.

   Each entry in the RADIUS Authentication Client Table includes twelve
   columns presenting a view of the activity of the RADIUS
   authentication server.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information. These are:

   radiusAuthClientAddress
             This can be used to determine the address of the RADIUS
             authentication client with which the server is
             communicating.  This information could be useful in
             impersonating the client.

   radiusAuthClientID This can be used to determine the client ID of the
             authentication client with which the server is
             communicating.  This information could be useful in



Zorn & Aboba                Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 2619            RADIUS Authentication Server MIB           June 1999


             impersonating the client.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.  Using these
   security features, customer/users can give access to the objects only
   to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
