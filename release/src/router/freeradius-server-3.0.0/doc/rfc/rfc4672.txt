Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes the Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) (RFC2865) Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)
   functions that support the dynamic authorization extensions as
   defined in RFC 3576.

RFC 4672        RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB   September 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes the Remote Authentication Dial-In User
   Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)
   functions that support the dynamic authorization extensions as
   defined in RFC 3576.

   It is becoming increasingly important to support Dynamic
   Authorization extensions on the network access server (NAS) devices
   to handle the Disconnect and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) messages,
   as described in [RFC3576].  As a result, the effective management of
   RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entities is of considerable importance.
   This RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB complements the managed
   objects used for managing RADIUS authentication and accounting
   servers, as described in [RFC4669] and [RFC4671], respectively.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)

   The component that resides on the NAS that processes the Disconnect
   and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) Request packets [RFC3576] sent by
   the Dynamic Authorization Client.

   Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)

   The component that sends Disconnect and CoA-Request packets to the
   Dynamic Authorization Server.  Although this component often resides
   on the RADIUS server, it is also possible for this component to be
   located on a separate host, such as a Rating Engine.

   Dynamic Authorization Server Port

   The UDP port on which the Dynamic Authorization Server listens for
   the Disconnect and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization
   Client.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   "Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS" [RFC3576] defines the
   operation of Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK,
   CoA-Request, CoA-ACK, and CoA-NAK packets.  [RFC4673] defines the
   Dynamic Authorization Server MIB and the relationship with other MIB
   modules.  This MIB module for the Dynamic Authorization Client
   contains the following:

   1.  Two scalar objects

   2.  One Dynamic Authorization Server table.  This table contains one
       row for each DAS with which the DAC shares a secret.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

RFC 4672        RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB   September 2006


   radiusDynAuthServerAddress and radiusDynAuthServerAddressType

      These can be used to determine the address of the DAS with which
      the DAC is communicating.  This information could be useful in
      mounting an attack on the DAS.

   radiusDynAuthServerID

      This can be used to determine the Identifier of the DAS.  This
      information could be useful in impersonating the DAS.

   radiusDynAuthServerClientPortNumber

      This can be used to determine the destination port number to which
      the DAC is sending.  This information could be useful in mounting
      an attack on the DAS.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned OID number 145 under mib-2.
