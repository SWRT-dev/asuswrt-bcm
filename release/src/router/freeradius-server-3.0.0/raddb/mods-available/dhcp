#  This module is useful only for 'xlat'.  To use it,
#  put 'dhcp' into the 'instantiate' section.
#
#  %{dhcp_options:<Attribute-ref>} may be used to decode
#  DHCP options data included in RADIUS packets by vendors
#  of DHCP to RADIUS gateways.
#
#  This is known to work with the following VSAs:
#	* Juniper		- ERX-Dhcp-Options
#	* Alcatel lucent SR	- Alc-ToServer-Dhcp-Options
#				- Alc-ToClient-Dhcp-Options
