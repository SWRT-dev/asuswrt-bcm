.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.HP
\fB\-\-foreground\fR
.IP
When not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,
allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and receive TTY signals.
In this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out.
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-kill\-after\fR=\fIDURATION\fR
.IP
also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running
this long after the initial signal was sent.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fISIGNAL\fR
.IP
specify the signal to be sent on timeout.
SIGNAL may be a name like `HUP' or a number.
See `kill \fB\-l\fR` for a list of signals
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix:
`s' for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' for days.
.PP
If the command times out, then exit with status 124.  Otherwise, exit
with the status of COMMAND.  If no signal is specified, send the TERM
signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills any process that does not
block or catch that signal.  For other processes, it may be necessary to
use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught.
