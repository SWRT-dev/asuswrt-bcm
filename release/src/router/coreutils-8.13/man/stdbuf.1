.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its standard streams.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fIMODE\fR
adjust standard input stream buffering
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIMODE\fR
adjust standard output stream buffering
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-error\fR=\fIMODE\fR
adjust standard error stream buffering
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
If MODE is `L' the corresponding stream will be line buffered.
This option is invalid with standard input.
.PP
If MODE is `0' the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.
.PP
Otherwise MODE is a number which may be followed by one of the following:
KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
In this case the corresponding stream will be fully buffered with the buffer
size set to MODE bytes.
.PP
NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard streams (`tee' does
for e.g.) then that will override corresponding settings changed by `stdbuf'.
Also some filters (like `dd' and `cat' etc.) don't use streams for I/O,
and are thus unaffected by `stdbuf' settings.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B tail -f access.log | stdbuf -oL cut -d \(aq \(aq -f1 | uniq
.br
This will immedidately display unique entries from access.log
.SH BUGS
On GLIBC platforms, specifying a buffer size, i.e. using fully buffered mode
will result in undefined operation.
