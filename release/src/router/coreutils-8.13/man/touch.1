.SH SYNOPSIS
.B touch
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFILE\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.
.PP
A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-h\fR
is supplied.
.PP
A FILE argument string of \- is handled specially and causes touch to
change the times of the file associated with standard output.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

\fB\-a\fR

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-no\-create\fR

.TP
\fB\-f\fR

.SH "DATE STRING"
.\" NOTE: keep this paragraph in sync with the one in date.x
The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string
such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or
even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating
calendar date, time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time,
relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning
of the day.  The date string format is more complex than is easily
documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.
