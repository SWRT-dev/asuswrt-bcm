# Test for a bug in coreutils up through 8.7: od was losing
# information when asked to parse floating-point values.  The numeric
# tests are valid only on Intel-like hosts, but that should be good
# enough to detect regressions, as they are designed to succeed on
# non-Intel-like hosts.  Also, test for another bug in coreutils 8.7
# on x86: sometimes there was no space between the columns.
