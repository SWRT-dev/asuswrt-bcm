#  This file can either contain all your chilli configurations, or include
#  other files, as shown per default below. The idea here is that main.conf
#  contains your main configurations, hs.conf is for your configurations
#  delivered by RADIUS (using the Administrative-User login), and local.conf 
#  is for any other settings you might configure by hand for this particular
#  installation. 

include /etc/chilli/main.conf
include /etc/chilli/hs.conf
include /etc/chilli/local.conf
