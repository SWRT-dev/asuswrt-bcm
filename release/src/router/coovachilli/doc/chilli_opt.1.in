chilli_opt \-  Configuration utility for CoovaChilli

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chilli_opt
<chilli-options> 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chilli_opt
is a utility to configure a 
.B chilli
server. The utility take all the arguments of CoovaChilli, parses the
configuration file, and then write out the configuration into a binary
form ready for a running chilli server to pick up and use (without
delay).

This utilitiy is executed by 
.B chilli
from a forked process to off-line the processing of the configuration, including
waiting for any DNS resolution, etc. When 
.B chilli_opt
is done processing the configuration, it writes it to a binary format (and system
architecture depended) file. When executed by 
.B chilli
the binary file used is 
.I config.bin
found in a process specific directory in the temporary file system, such as
.I /tmp/chilli-1000/config.bin
where 1000 is the process id of the running 
.B chilli
server.
