.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chilli
is a software access controller typically used in Wireless LAN HotSpot. It
supports of two different access methods for a Wireless LAN HotSpot:
Universal Access Method (UAM) as well as Wireless Protected Access
(WPA). This version of 
.B chilli
is called CoovaChilli, a fork of the original ChilliSpot. See
.I http://www.coova.org/
for more information.

.B chilli
has three major interfaces: A downlink interface for accepting
connections from clients, a radius interface for authenticating
clients and an uplink network interface for forwarding traffic to
other networks.

Authentication of clients is performed by an external radius
server. For UAM the CHAP-Challenge and CHAP-Password as specified by
RFC 2865 is used. For WPA the radius EAP-Message attribute as defined
in RFC 2869 is used. The message attributes described in RFC 2548 are
used for transferring encryption keys from the radius server to
chilli. Furthermore the radius interface supports accounting.

The downlink interface accepts DHCP and ARP requests from clients. The
client can be in two states: Unauthenticated and authenticated. In
unauthenticated state, web requests from the client are redirected to
an authentication web server - the captive portal.

In a typical application unauthenticated clients will be forwarded to
a web server and prompted for username and password. The web
server forwards the user credentials to
.B chilli
by means of web browser redirects. On the
.B chilli
side, authentication requests are forwarded to a radius server. If
authentication is successful the state of the client is changed to
authenticated. This authentication method is known as Universal Access
Method (UAM).

As an alternative to UAM, the access points can be configured to
authenticate the clients by using Wireless Protected Access (WPA). In
this case, authentication credentials are forwarded from the WPA access
point to
.B chilli
by using the radius protocol. The received radius request is proxied by 
.B chilli
and forwarded to the radius server.

The uplink interface is implemented by using the 
.B TUN/TAP driver.
When 
.B chilli
is started, a tun interface is established and an optional external
configuration script is called.

Runtime errors are reported using the
.B syslogd (8)
facility.

.SH OPTIONS

Configuration parameters set on the command line always take precedent over
anything configured in a file. See
.BR chilli.conf(5)
for a complete list of possible configurations. Here are just a few common command
line options:

.TP
.BI --help
Print help and exit.

.TP
.BI --version
Print version and exit.

.TP
.BI --fg
Run in foreground (default = off)

.TP
.BI --debug
Run in debug mode (default = off)

.TP
.BI --conf " file"
Configuration file to use instead of the default below. See 
.BR chilli.conf(5)
for more inforamtion.

.TP
.BI --pidfile " file"
File to put the process ID instead of the default below.

.TP
.BI --cmdsock " file"
UNIX socket file for inter-process communication instead of default below.

.TP
.BI --statedir " path"
Directory of nonvolatile data instead of default below.


.SH FILES
.I /etc/chilli.conf
.RS
The main 
.B chilli
configuration file.

.RE
.I /etc/chilli/defaults
.RS
Default configurations used by the 
.B chilli
init.d and 
.B functions
scripts.
.RE

.RE
.I /etc/chilli/config
.RS
Location specific configurations used by
.B chilli
init.d and 
.B functions
scripts. Copy the 
.B defaults
file mentioned above and edit.
.RE

.RE
.I /etc/chilli/functions
.RS
Helps configure 
.B chilli
by loading the above configurations, sets some defaults, and
provides functions for writing 
.B main.conf, hs.conf, 
and
.B local.conf 
based on local and possibily centralized. See
.BR chilli.conf(5)
.RE

.RE
.I /etc/init.d/chilli
.RS
The init.d file for 
.B chilli
which defaults to using the above configurations to build a set of
configurations files in the /etc/chilli directory - taking local
configurations and optionally centralized configurations from RADIUS or a
URL. See
.BR chilli.conf(5)

.RE
.I /var/run/chilli.sock
.RS
UNIX socket used to daemon communication. See
.BR chilli_query(1)
.RE

.RE
.I /var/run/chilli.pid
.RS
Process ID file.
.RE

.RE
.I /etc/chilli/www/
.RS
The typical directory for embedded web content served up by
.B chilli
using a minimal web server. A convenient place for the splash page, embedded
captive portal, and JSON javascript resources.
.RE

.SH SIGNALS
Sending HUP to chilli will cause the configuration file to be reread
and DNS lookups to be performed.
The configuration options are not affected by sending HUP:
.B fg
,
.B conf 
,
.B pidfile 
,
.B statedir 
,
.B net 
,
.B dynip 
,
.B statip 
,
.B uamlisten 
,
.B uamport 
,
.B radiuslisten 
,
.B coaport 
,
.B coanoipcheck 
,
.B proxylisten 
,
.B proxyport 
,
.B proxyclient 
,
.B proxysecret 
,
.B dhcpif 
,
.B dhcpmac 
,
.B lease 
, or
.B eapolenable


The above configuration options can only be changed by restarting the daemon.

.SH NOTES 
.LP

See
.I http://www.coova.org/
for further documentation and community support.
The original ChilliSpot project homepage is/was at www.chillispot.org.

Besides the long options documented in this man page
.B chilli
also accepts a number of short options with the same functionality. Use
.B chilli --help
for a full list of all the available options.

The 
.B TUN/TAP driver is required 
for proper operation of the
.B chilli
server. Linux kernels later than 2.4.7 already include the driver,
but typically needs to be loaded manually with
.B modprobe tun
or automaticly by adding
.B alias char-major-10-200 tun
to the
.B /etc/modules.conf
configuration file. For other platforms see
.I http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/
for information on how to install and configure the TUN/TAP driver.
