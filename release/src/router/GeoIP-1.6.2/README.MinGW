# how to build under MinGW/MSYS:
# (first you need to build & "install" zlib)

export "CFLAGS=-O3 -I/usr/local/include"
export "LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib -lwsock32 -lws2_32"
./configure
make
cp data/GeoIP.dat test/
make check

# note that GeoIP.dat file should be placed in the
# same place as GeoIP-enabled executable modules!
# there's NO DEFAULT PATH concept on Win32 :)
