/**
 * SECTION:gapplication
 * @title: GApplication
 * @short_description: Core application class
 *
 * A #GApplication is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
 * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
 * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
 * #GtkApplication or #MxApplication.  In general, you should not use
 * this class outside of a higher level framework.
 *
 * GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
 * a <firstterm>use count</firstterm> for the primary application instance.
 * The use count can be changed using g_application_hold() and
 * g_application_release(). If it drops to zero, the application exits.
 * Higher-level classes such as #GtkApplication employ the use count to
 * ensure that the application stays alive as long as it has any opened
 * windows.
 *
 * Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
 * uniqueness.  Applications can make use of this functionality by
 * providing a unique application ID.  If given, only one application
 * with this ID can be running at a time per session.  The session
 * concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
 * desktop login.  When your application is launched again, its
 * arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
 * running program.  The already running instance of the program is
 * called the <firstterm>primary instance</firstterm>; for non-unique
 * applications this is the always the current instance.
 * On Linux, the D-Bus session bus is used for communication.
 *
 * The use of #GApplication differs from some other commonly-used
 * uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways.  The
 * application is not expected to manually register itself and check if
 * it is the primary instance.  Instead, the <code>main()</code>
 * function of a #GApplication should do very little more than
 * instantiating the application instance, possibly connecting signal
 * handlers, then calling g_application_run().  All checks for
 * uniqueness are done internally.  If the application is the primary
 * instance then the startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs.
 * If the application is not the primary instance then a signal is sent
 * to the primary instance and g_application_run() promptly returns.
 * See the code examples below.
 *
 * If used, the expected form of an application identifier is very close
 * to that of of a
 * <ulink url="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-interface">DBus bus name</ulink>.
 * Examples include: "com.example.MyApp", "org.example.internal-apps.Calculator".
 * For details on valid application identifiers, see g_application_id_is_valid().
 *
 * On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
 * on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
 * application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
 * application may provide additional services (through registration of other
 * object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
 * should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
 * internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
 * (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
 * any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
 * attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
 * g_application_register()).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
 * g_application_get_is_remote() to decide if you want to register object paths.
 *
 * GApplication also implements the #GActionGroup and #GActionMap
 * interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
 * g_action_map_add_action(). When invoking an action by calling
 * g_action_group_activate_action() on the application, it is always
 * invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
 * the session bus, and GIO provides the #GDBusActionGroup wrapper to
 * conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a #GDBusMenuModel wrapper
 * for remote access to exported #GMenuModels.
 *
 * There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)</listitem>
 * <listitem>via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)</listitem>
 * <listitem>by handling a command-line</listitem>
 * <listitem>via activating an action</listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
 * initialization for all of these in a single place.
 *
 * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the application,
 * GApplication passes some <firstterm id="platform-data">platform
 * data</firstterm> from the launching instance to the primary instance,
 * in the form of a #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to variants.
 * To use platform data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit virtual
 * functions in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
 * #GApplicationCommandLine objects, the platform data is directly
 * available via g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
 * g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
 * g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
 *
 * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
 * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
 * "cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
 * variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
 * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
 * %G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT flag is set. #GApplication subclasses
 * can add their own platform data by overriding the @add_platform_data
 * virtual function. For instance, #GtkApplication adds startup notification
 * data in this way.
 *
 * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()
 * vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or the local instance,
 * respectively.

/**
 * GApplicationClass:
 * @startup: invoked on the primary instance immediately after registration
 * @shutdown: invoked only on the registered primary instance immediately
 *      after the main loop terminates
 * @activate: invoked on the primary instance when an activation occurs
 * @open: invoked on the primary instance when there are files to open
 * @command_line: invoked on the primary instance when a command-line is
 *   not handled locally
 * @local_command_line: invoked (locally) when the process has been invoked
 *     via commandline execution (as opposed to, say, D-Bus activation - which
 *     is not currently supported by GApplication). The virtual function has
 *     the chance to inspect (and possibly replace) the list of command line
 *     arguments. See g_application_run() for more information.
 * @before_emit: invoked on the primary instance before 'activate', 'open',
 *     'command-line' or any action invocation, gets the 'platform data' from
 *     the calling instance
 * @after_emit: invoked on the primary instance after 'activate', 'open',
 *     'command-line' or any action invocation, gets the 'platform data' from
 *     the calling instance
 * @add_platform_data: invoked (locally) to add 'platform data' to be sent to
 *     the primary instance when activating, opening or invoking actions
 * @quit_mainloop: Used to be invoked on the primary instance when the use
 *     count of the application drops to zero (and after any inactivity
 *     timeout, if requested). Not used anymore since 2.32
 * @run_mainloop: Used to be invoked on the primary instance from
 *     g_application_run() if the use-count is non-zero. Since 2.32,
 *     GApplication is iterating the main context directly and is not
 *     using @run_mainloop anymore
 * @dbus_register: invoked locally during registration, if the application is
 *     using its D-Bus backend. You can use this to export extra objects on the
 *     bus, that need to exist before the application tries to own the bus name.
 *     The function is passed the #GDBusConnection to to session bus, and the
 *     object path that #GApplication will use to export is D-Bus API.
 *     If this function returns %TRUE, registration will proceed; otherwise
 *     registration will abort. Since: 2.34
 * @dbus_unregister: invoked locally during unregistration, if the application
 *     is using its D-Bus backend. Use this to undo anything done by the
 *     @dbus_register vfunc. Since: 2.34
 *
 * Virtual function table for #GApplication.
 *
 * Since: 2.28

 *
 * If there is no application ID or if %G_APPLICATION_NON_UNIQUE was
 * given, then this process will always become the primary instance.
 *
 * Due to the internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be
 * dispatched at any time (even if a main loop is not running).  For
 * this reason, you must ensure that any object paths that you wish to
 * register are registered before calling this function.
 *
 * If the application has already been registered then %TRUE is

 *
 * The #GApplication::startup signal is emitted if registration succeeds
 * and @application is the primary instance (including the non-unique
 * case).
 *
 * In the event of an error (such as @cancellable being cancelled, or a
 * failure to connect to the session bus), %FALSE is returned and @error

 * @argc: the argc from main() (or 0 if @argv is %NULL)

 *
 * Runs the application.
 *
 * This function is intended to be run from main() and its return value
 * is intended to be returned by main(). Although you are expected to pass
 * the @argc, @argv parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
 * to pass %NULL if @argv is not available or commandline handling is not
 * required.
 *
 * First, the local_command_line() virtual function is invoked.
 * This function always runs on the local instance. It gets passed a pointer
 * to a %NULL-terminated copy of @argv and is expected to remove the arguments
 * that it handled (shifting up remaining arguments). See
 * <xref linkend="gapplication-example-cmdline2"/> for an example of
 * parsing @argv manually. Alternatively, you may use the #GOptionContext API,
 * after setting <literal>argc = g_strv_length (argv);</literal>.
 *
 * The last argument to local_command_line() is a pointer to the @status
 * variable which can used to set the exit status that is returned from
 * g_application_run().
 *
 * If local_command_line() returns %TRUE, the command line is expected
 * to be completely handled, including possibly registering as the primary
 * instance, calling g_application_activate() or g_application_open(), etc.
 *
 * If local_command_line() returns %FALSE then the application is registered
 * and the #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted in the primary
 * instance (which may or may not be this instance). The signal handler
 * gets passed a #GApplicationCommandLine object that (among other things)
 * contains the remaining commandline arguments that have not been handled
 * by local_command_line().
 *
 * If the application has the %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE
 * flag set then the default implementation of local_command_line()
 * always returns %FALSE immediately, resulting in the commandline
 * always being handled in the primary instance.
 *
 * Otherwise, the default implementation of local_command_line() tries
 * to do a couple of things that are probably reasonable for most
 * applications.  First, g_application_register() is called to attempt
 * to register the application.  If that works, then the command line
 * arguments are inspected.  If no commandline arguments are given, then
 * g_application_activate() is called.  If commandline arguments are
 * given and the %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN flag is set then they
 * are assumed to be filenames and g_application_open() is called.
 *
 * If you need to handle commandline arguments that are not filenames,
 * and you don't mind commandline handling to happen in the primary
 * instance, you should set %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE and
 * process the commandline arguments in your #GApplication::command-line
 * signal handler, either manually or using the #GOptionContext API.
 *
 * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
 * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
 * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
 * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
 * suppress the default handling. See
 * <xref linkend="gapplication-example-cmdline2"/> for an example.
 *
 * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
 * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
 * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
 * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
 *
 * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
 * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
 * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
 * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
 * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
 * use.
 *
 * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
 * to the basename of argv[0].  Since 2.38, if %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE
 * is specified, the prgname is set to the application ID.  The main
 * impact of this is is that the wmclass of windows created by Gtk+ will
 * be set accordingly, which helps the window manager determine which
 * application is showing the window.
 *
 * Returns: the exit status
