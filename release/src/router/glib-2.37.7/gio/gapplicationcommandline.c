/**
 * SECTION:gapplicationcommandline
 * @title: GApplicationCommandLine
 * @short_description: A command-line invocation of an application
 * @see_also: #GApplication
 *
 * #GApplicationCommandLine represents a command-line invocation of
 * an application.  It is created by #GApplication and emitted
 * in the #GApplication::command-line signal and virtual function.
 *
 * The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
 * with.  It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
 * local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
 * invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
 * commandline to this process).
 *
 * The GApplicationCommandLine object can provide the @argc and @argv
 * parameters for use with the #GOptionContext command-line parsing API,
 * with the g_application_command_line_get_arguments() function. See
 * <xref linkend="gapplication-example-cmdline3"/> for an example.
 *
 * The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
 * messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.  The
 * lifecycle of the originally-invoked process is tied to the lifecycle
 * of this object (ie: the process exits when the last reference is
 * dropped).
 *
 * The main use for #GApplicationCommandLine (and the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
 * You can set the <envar>EDITOR</envar> environment variable to have
 * e.g. git use your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you
 * already have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
 * in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
 * aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
 * does not return until the editing is done.
 *
 * <example id="gapplication-example-cmdline"><title>Handling commandline arguments with GApplication</title>
 * <para>
 * A simple example where the commandline is completely handled
 * in the #GApplication::command-line handler. The launching instance exits
 * once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and the
 * return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status of the launching
 * instance.

 * <example id="gapplication-example-cmdline2"><title>Split commandline handling</title>
 * <para>
 * An example of split commandline handling. Options that start with
 * <literal>--local-</literal> are handled locally, all other options are
 * passed to the #GApplication::command-line handler which runs in the primary
 * instance.

 *
 * <example id="gapplication-example-cmdline3"><title>Deferred commandline handling</title>
 * <para>
 * An example of deferred commandline handling. Here, the commandline is
 * not completely handled before the #GApplication::command-line handler
 * returns. Instead, we keep a reference to the GApplicationCommandLine
 * object and handle it later(in this example, in an idle). Note that it
 * is necessary to hold the application until you are done with the
 * commandline.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * This example also shows how to use #GOptionContext for parsing the
 * commandline arguments. Note that it is necessary to disable the
 * built-in help-handling of #GOptionContext, since it calls exit()
 * after printing help, which is not what you want to happen in
 * the primary instance.
