These things would be nice to have:


These things will change in future udev versions:
  o warn if BUS, ID, SYSFS are used as keys
    (they are SUBSYSTEMS, KERNELS, ATTRS now)


These things are deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future
udev version:
  o remove udevstart
    (we rely on the kernel "uevent"-triggers of kernel 2.6.15 and no longer
     want to guess event-properties from sysfs like udevstart is doing it)
