0.Introduction
==============

 The conntrack-tools package contains two programs:

  - conntrack:	the command line interface to interact with the connection 
		tracking system.

  - conntrackd: the connection tracking userspace daemon that can be used to
  		deploy highly available GNU/Linux firewalls and collect 
		statistics of the firewall use.

 Although their names are similar, they are used for different tasks.

1. Requirements
===============

 You have to install the following software in order to get the conntrack-tools
 working, make sure that you have installed them correctly before going forward:

 o linux kernel version >= 2.6.18 (http://www.kernel.org) that, at least,
   has support for:

     - connection tracking system
	   CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK=m
	   CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4=m
	   CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_IPV6=m (if you need IPv6 support)

     - nfnetlink
           CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK=m

     - ctnetlink (nf_conntrack_netlink)
           CONFIG_NF_CT_NETLINK=m

     - connection tracking event notification API
           CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS=y

     	(To check that the event API is enabled in the kernel, make sure
	 you have loaded nf_netlink_conntrack module, run conntrack -E and 
	 generate traffic, you should see network events)

 o libnfnetlink: the netfilter netlink library available at:

     <http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnfnetlink/files/>

 o libnetfilter_conntrack: the netfilter conntrack library available at:

     <http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libnetfilter_conntrack/files/>

2.Compilation and Installation
==============================

 To compile and install conntrack-tools just follow the classical steps:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	$ make
	# make install

 Up to this point, the command line interface `conntrack' is ready for use,
 see man conntrack(8). However, the userspace daemon so-called `conntrackd' 
 requires some magic spells to get it working.

 *Fedora users*: If you are trying to install the libraries in /usr/local/,
 do not forget to do the following things:

	* PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig; export PKG_CONFIG_PATH
 	* Add `/usr/local/lib' to your /etc/ld.so.conf file and run `ldconfig'
 
 Check `ldd' for trouble-shooting, read <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html#AEN70> for more information on how libraries work.

3.How-to use and set up
=======================

 Please, refer to the user manual for further information on how to use and
 set up the conntrack-tools. This user manual is is available in the 
 documentation directory included in this tarball.
