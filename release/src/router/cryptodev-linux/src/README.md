# cryptodev-linux

This is a `/dev/crypto` device driver, equivalent to those in OpenBSD or
FreeBSD. The main idea is to access existing ciphers in kernel space
from userspace, thus enabling the re-use of a hardware implementation of a
cipher.

## How to combine with cryptographic libraries

### GnuTLS

GnuTLS needs to be compiled with `--enable-cryptodev` in order to take
advantage of `/dev/crypto`. GnuTLS 3.0.14 or later is recommended.

### OpenSSL

OpenSSL needs `-DHAVE_CRYPTODEV` and `-DUSE_CRYPTODEV_DIGESTS` flags
during compilation. Note that the latter flag (digests) may induce
a performance penalty in some systems.

## Modifying and viewing verbosity at runtime

The verbosity of the driver often needs to be adjusted for debugging.
The `sysctl` tool can be used for that.

```
# sysctl ioctl.cryptodev_verbosity
ioctl.cryptodev_verbosity = 0

# sysctl ioctl.cryptodev_verbosity=3
ioctl.cryptodev_verbosity = 3
```
