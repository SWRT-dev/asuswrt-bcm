at the outset the gateway authenticates itself to the client by sending an
IKEv2 <b>RSA signature</b> accompanied by a certificate.
The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
<b>carol</b> uses the <i>Extensible Authentication Protocol</i>
in association with the <i>Authentication and Key Agreement</i> protocol
(<b>EAP-AKA</b>) to authenticate against the gateway. This protocol is used
in UMTS, but here a secret from <b>ipsec.secrets</b> is used instead of a USIM/(R)UIM.
In addition to her IKEv2 identity <b>carol@strongswan.org</b>, roadwarrior <b>carol</b>
uses the EAP identity <b>carol</b>.
