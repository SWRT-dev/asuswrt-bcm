The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>IF-TNCCS 1.1</b> client-server interface.
The Dummy IMC and IMV from the
<a href="http://trust.f4.hs-hannover.de/projects/tncatfhh.html" target="popup">
<b>TNC@FHH</b></a> project are used which communicate over a proprietary protocol.
<p>
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these measurements the
clients are connected by gateway <b>moon</b> to the "rw-allow" and "rw-isolate" subnets,
respectively.
