This directory contains files useful for initialization
scripts, especially for RedHat.

There are two choices, lm_sensors.init and sensord.init.
Use one or the other but not both!

----------------

The script lm_sensors.init is a nice startup/shutdown script.
On RH and other RH-based systems (MDK, notably) use this sort of startup
mechanism (i.e. SVR4-based), as opposed to the everything-in-one-script
(/etc/rc or /etc/rc.local) like the BSD-based systems do.
The lm_sensors.init file should be copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/lm_sensors.
For more information see the top of the file.
It requires the /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors file, which identifies
the correct modules.

The /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors file is generated by running sensors-detect.
Once the script is done detecting the hardware monitoring devices, it will
list all the required modules in that file, so that they can be loaded
automatically at boot time.

----------------

The script sensord.init also loads the modules, and then
starts the sensord daemon. See the manual page sensord(8) for
more information on the daemon.

The sensord.init file should be copied to /etc/rc.d/init.d/sensord.
For more information see the top of the file.

To configure this service one should put appropriate "alias i2c-bus-0 xxx"
and "alias i2c-sensors-chip-0 xxx" in /etc/modules.conf.
