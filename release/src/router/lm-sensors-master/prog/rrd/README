OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains shell and cgi scripts which maintain a
database of sensor data and generate web pages containing
graphs of sensor data.

The RRD (Round Robin Database) package is REQUIRED.
Get this package from
         http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/

A web server with CGI support is required.

We have provided these scripts because the RRD package,
while simple to build and install, is rather difficult
to configure to store and display data.

RRD, together with lm_sensors and these scripts, provide the
following advantages:
	- True round-robin (constant-size) database
	- On-the-fly graph generation with CGI scripts
	- Multiple data views using single database
	- Automatic time stamping, interpolation of missing data,
	  large data dropouts (during machine downtime) correctly
	  shown on graphs

If you are looking for something a little simpler,
that does not require RRD, try ../tellerstats.

The RRD scripts read /sys entries and do not use libsensors.
Therefore the scale factors in /etc/sensors.conf are not used,
and you may have to change the scale factors in the cgi scripts.


WARNING!
--------
The 'make install' script tries to make it easy for you but
makes a lot of assumptions about your cron and web setup.
If you have any concerns, do NOT run make install, and
install the items by hand instead.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

	- Make and install lm_sensors. Get it working (run 'sensors')
	  before you try this!
	- Get RRD, make and install it
	- Edit the top of the Makefile. Do NOT skip this step.
	  The defaults will probably not work for you.
	  Here are the defaults:
		Cron user
			USER=httpd
		Path to rrdtool and rrdcgi
			RRDPATH=/usr/bin
		Place to install sens_update_rrd script
			BINPATH=/usr/local/bin
		Place to store the database
			RRDDIR=/var/lib/sensors-rrd
		Place to put the cgi script and the graphs
			APACHE=/usr/local/apache/htdocs
			APACHDIR=$(APACHE)/senspix
		The sensor device in your system
		(isa recommended over i2c if both are available)
			SENSDEV=hwmon0           (look in /sys/class/hwmon)
	- make
	- (as root) make install, which does the following.
	  If you don't want it to do this, install by hand!!!
		Creates a database
		Installs the data gathering script
		Installs the CGI script in your web server
	- Manually add the following line to the crontab for
	  the user specified above, which will call the data gathering
	  script every 5 minutes (adjust paths as necessary)
		*/5 * * * *	/usr/local/bin/sens_update_rrd /var/lib/sensors-rrd/sensors.rrd hwmon0
	- Load http://localhost/senspix/sens_day.cgi in your web browser
		to test


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
	RRD problems: See the RRD documentation

	Cron problems: check the cron logs, maybe your cron format
		is different or you need to signal the cron daemon?

	Unused sensors: remove appropriate sections from sens_*.cgi.in
		and remake and install.

	Sensor scaling factors incorrect (in3-in6): Edit lines in
		sens_*.cgi.in that start
		'CDEF:' to change the scale factor.

	CGI problems: Check the apache logs. If CGI is not enabled for
		the directory add a .htaccess file to the directory
		including the line
			Options ExecCGI 

	Removing the "RRDTOOL / TOBI OETIKER" tag in RRD graphs:
		Comment out the line 
			gator(gif, (int) im->xgif-5, 5);
		in src/rrd_graph.c in the RRD package.
