This is a list of additional programs, that may or may not be installed by
`make install', and that can be found in the `prog' directory of
this package.

These programs are generally small utilities used for debugging,
and installation of the lm_sensors package, and for demonstrating
the use of the drivers and libraries in this package.
For more elaborate programs (for example, GUI sensor displays),
see http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/UsefulLinks.


* prog/daemon/healthd.sh (written in bash, not installed)
  An example of a very simple hardware health monitoring daemon.

* prog/detect/sensors-detect (written in Perl, installed by 'make install')
  This program tries to detect the available SMBus adapters and the chips
  connected to them, as well as Super-I/O and misc chips. It also generates
  modprobe lines and module options. This program is stand-alone (can be
  run without installing lm-sensors) and interactive.

* prog/dump/isadump (written in C, installed by 'make install')
  This program dumps the registers of ISA or Super-I/O chips.
  Usual syntax:
     isadump 0x295 0x296
     isadump -k 0x55 0x2e 0x2f

* prog/hotplug/unhide_ICH_SMBus (shell script, not installed)
  It unhides the ICH Intel SMBus for kernel 2.6.5 and later.

* prog/init/lm_sensors.init (shell script, not installed)
  A SysV init script to be installed in /etc/rc.d/init.d/
  It inserts the bus and chip modules.

* prog/init/sensord.init (shell script, not installed)
  A SysV init script to be installed in /etc/rc.d/init.d/
  It inserts the bus and chip modules and starts the sensord daemon.

* prog/pwm/pwmconfig (shell script, installed by 'make install')
  Formerly pwmtest, tests the pwm (pulse width modulation) outputs of sensors
  for their effect on the fans and helps to setup the configfile for fancontrol.

* prog/pwm/fancontrol (shell script, installed by 'make install')
  Controls fanspeeds responding to changes on temperature sensors.
  Configuration through pwmconfig.

* prog/rrd/sens_update_rrd (written in bash, not installed)
  This script gathers sensors data and adds it to a round robin database
  (RRD). RRD is then used to display the graphed data in web pages.
  See prog/rrd/README for more information.

* prog/sensord/sensord (written in C, installed by `make install-prog-sensord')
  This daemon can be used to periodically log sensor readings from
  the sensors hardware to syslog, and to alert (using syslog level ALERT)
  when a sensor alarm is signalled; for example, if a fan fails, a temperature
  limit is exceeded, etc.

* prog/sensors/sensors (written in C, installed by `make install')
  This pretty-prints the information provided by the modules. It is a normal
  console application, using stdout. It is essential, because
  unlike the raw sysfs files, it takes your configuration file into account.

* prog/tellerstats/gather.sh, tellerstats.sh (written in bash, not installed)
  These scripts gather sensors data and graph the data for web pages.
  See prog/tellerstats/README for more information.
