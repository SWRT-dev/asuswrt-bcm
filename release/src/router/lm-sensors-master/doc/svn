Subversion Repository 

Anonymous access to our Subversion repository (SVN) is available. This means
that users can have direct access to up-to-the-minute code.
(http://subversion.tigris.org/)

Driver development for kernel version 3 is taking place directly in the kernel
using GIT. Do not use the drivers from our SVN repository for kernel version
2.6 or 3, it will not work. The user-space tools will work though.

We presume that you have Subversion installed on your machine. To check out a
working copy of the code for this project use the following commands:

svn checkout http://lm-sensors.org/svn/i2c/trunk i2c
svn checkout http://lm-sensors.org/svn/lm-sensors/trunk lm-sensors

To update the code, do a svn update from within the i2c or lm-sensors
directories. Please read the README and INSTALL files of your working copy
for how to build the code. Also read the related files in the 'doc' directory
for info regarding the different bus and chip drivers. Lastly, you can use
the regular svn commands on the files (like svn log [filename]) to see the
comments made by the developers as changes were made.

If you're not familiar with the use of Subversion we recommend the excellent
Subversion book which is a valuable resource.

Commits to the repositories are notified on the lm-sensors-notify
mailing-list. Feel free to subscribe if you want to be informed of the
changes made to the i2c and lm-sensors repositories.
