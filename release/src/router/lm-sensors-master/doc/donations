The lm_sensors team gratefully acknowledges the following donations.

Drivers are very difficult to develop without actual hardware.
Generally, the work goes quickly once we have the hardware.

Evaluation boards are fine. Real computer hardware is much better though,
because it lets us do real-world testing over a longer period of time.
In many cases, the way a chipset is integrated in systems must be taken
into account in the driver, and evaluation boards don't help much there.
Donation of usable computer hardware also supports the project in general,
so hardware which isn't directly related to the development of a hardware
monitoring driver, but can be used to build test systems, is welcome too.

If you would like to make a donation, please contact us. See
http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/AuthorsAndContributors. Thanks!


Donations are listed in chronological order. Note that the person mentioned
is the one who holds the device now, which is not necessarily the one to whom
the donation was sent in the first place.
