# This service is usually not enabled by default. If enabled, it
# acts as a barrier for basic.target -- so all later services will
# wait for udev completely finishing its coldplug run.
#
# If needed, to work around broken or non-hotplug-aware services,
# it might be enabled unconditionally, or pulled-in on-demand by
# the services that assume a fully populated /dev at startup. It
# should not be used or pulled-in ever on systems without such
# legacy services running.
