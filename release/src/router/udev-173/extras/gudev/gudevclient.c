/**
 * SECTION:gudevclient
 * @short_description: Query devices and listen to uevents
 *
 * #GUdevClient is used to query information about devices on a Linux
 * system from the Linux kernel and the udev device
 * manager.
 *
 * Device information is retrieved from the kernel (through the
 * <literal>sysfs</literal> filesystem) and the udev daemon (through a
 * <literal>tmpfs</literal> filesystem) and presented through
 * #GUdevDevice objects. This means that no blocking IO ever happens
 * (in both cases, we are essentially just reading data from kernel
 * memory) and as such there are no asynchronous versions of the
 * provided methods.
 *
 * To get #GUdevDevice objects, use
 * g_udev_client_query_by_subsystem(),
 * g_udev_client_query_by_device_number(),
 * g_udev_client_query_by_device_file(),
 * g_udev_client_query_by_sysfs_path(),
 * g_udev_client_query_by_subsystem_and_name()
 * or the #GUdevEnumerator type.
 *
 * To listen to uevents, connect to the #GUdevClient::uevent signal.
