.SH NAME
.B getdns_root_trust_anchor
-- return the getdns list of default root trust anchors

.SH LIBRARY
DNS Resolver library (libgetdns, \-lgetdns)

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <getdns.h>

getdns_list * 
.br
.B getdns_root_trust_anchor
(time_t *utc_date_of_anchor)

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
If an application wants the API to perform DNSSEC validation without using the
extensions, it can use the getdns_validate_dnssec() helper function. The API
will use the resource records in bundle_of_support_records to construct the
validation chain and the DNSKEY or DS records in trust_anchor_records as trust
anchors. The default list of trust anchor records that is used by the library
to validate DNSSEC can be retrieved by using the getdns_root_trust_anchor
helper function.

.HP 3
.I utc_date_of_anchor
time the trust anchors were obtained in epoch seconds (on success)

.HP
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

Returns the default list of trust anchor records used by the library to validate DNSSEC or NULL if no default trust anchors are available.

.SH EXAMPLES

TBD
