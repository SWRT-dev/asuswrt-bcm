.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
If an application wants the API to perform DNSSEC validation without using the
extensions, it can use the getdns_validate_dnssec() helper function. The API
will use the resource records in bundle_of_support_records to construct the
validation chain and the DNSKEY or DS records in trust_anchor_records as trust
anchors. The default list of trust anchor records that is used by the library
to validate DNSSEC can be retrieved by using the getdns_root_trust_anchor
helper function.

.HP 3
.I record_to_validate
the resource record being validated

.HP 3
.I bundle_of_support_records
records used to construct the validation chain

.HP 3
.I trust_anchor_records
trust anchor records to use for the validation

.HP
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

.LP
.B GETDNS_DNSSEC_INDETERMINATE
validation could not be completed
.LP
.B GETDNS_DNSSEC_INSECURE
one or more pieces of the validation chain are demonstrably incorrect
.LP
