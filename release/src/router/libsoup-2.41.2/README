libsoup is an HTTP client/server library for GNOME. It uses GObjects
and the glib main loop, to integrate well with GNOME applications.

Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL support
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * XML-RPC support

See the documentation in docs/reference/ and the test programs in
tests/ for simple examples of how to use the code. The
evolution-data-server and evolution-exchange modules in GNOME CVS have
some more complicated examples.
