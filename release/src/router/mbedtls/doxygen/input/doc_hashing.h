/**
 * @addtogroup hashing_module Hashing module
 *
 * The Message Digest (MD) or Hashing module provides one-way hashing
 * functions. Such functions can be used for creating a hash message
 * authentication code (HMAC) when sending a message. Such a HMAC can be used
 * in combination with a private key for authentication, which is a message
 * integrity control.
 *
 * All hash algorithms can be accessed via the generic MD layer (see
 * \c mbedtls_md_setup())
 *
 * The following hashing-algorithms are provided:
 * - MD2, MD4, MD5 128-bit one-way hash functions by Ron Rivest.
 * - SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384/512 160-bit or more one-way hash functions by
 *   NIST and NSA.
 *
 * This module provides one-way hashing which can be used for authentication.
