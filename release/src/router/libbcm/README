This directory contains source files which are used to 
build the shared library 'libbcm.so'.

This shared library contains functions that can be used by
multiple applications on the Linux Router. The source
files that comprise this library are not subject to GPL. If 
you want to add a function that is shared by multiple
applications and which does not need to be part of the GPL
release, add the source file to this library. If the file 
has to be included as part of the GPL release, add it to
libshared.so.


WARNING:

Before adding files to this library, make absolutely sure 
that the files don't fall under GPL. Source files added to
this libraray should NOT be included in gpl-filelist.txt.
