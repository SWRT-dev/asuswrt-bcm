avahi.hosts \- avahi-daemon static host name file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/home/lennart/tmp/avahi/etc/avahi/hosts
\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fI/home/lennart/tmp/avahi/etc/avahi/hosts\f1 is a file which may be used to define static host name to IP address mappings for multicast DNS. This is especially useful when publishing DNS-SD services on behalf of other hosts. See \fBavahi.service(5)\f1 for more information.

The file format is similar to the one of \fI/etc/hosts\f1: on each line an IP address and the corresponding host name. The host names should be in FQDN form, i.e. with appended .local suffix.
