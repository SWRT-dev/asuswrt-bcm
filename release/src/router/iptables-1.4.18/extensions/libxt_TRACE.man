This target marks packets so that the kernel will log every rule which match 
the packets as those traverse the tables, chains, rules.
.PP
A logging backend, such as ip(6)t_LOG or nfnetlink_log, must be loaded for this
to be visible.
The packets are logged with the string prefix:
"TRACE: tablename:chainname:type:rulenum " where type can be "rule" for 
plain rule, "return" for implicit rule at the end of a user defined chain 
and "policy" for the policy of the built in chains. 
.br
It can only be used in the
.BR raw
table.
