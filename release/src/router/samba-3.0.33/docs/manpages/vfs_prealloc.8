.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
vfs objects = prealloc
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\.
.PP
The
vfs_prealloc
VFS module preallocates files to a specified size each time a new file is created\. This is useful in environments where files are of a predetermined size will be written to a disk subsystem where extending file allocations is expensive\.
.PP
This module is stackable\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
prealloc:EXT = BYTES
.RS 4
Preallocate all files with the extension EXT to the size specified by BYTES\.
.sp
The following suffixes may be applied to BYTES:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
K
\- BYTES is a number of kilobytes
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
M
\- BYTES is a number of megabytes
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
