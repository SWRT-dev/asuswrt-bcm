.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=level
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0\.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\fIlog level\fR
parameter in the
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
file\.
.RE
.PP
\-V

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer\. The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\.icce\.rug\.nl/pub/unix/) and updated for the Samba 2\.0 release by Jeremy Allison\. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2\.2 was done by Gerald Carter\. The conversion to DocBook XML 4\.2 for Samba 3\.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\.
