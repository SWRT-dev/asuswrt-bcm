.SH "NAME"
idmap_ad - Samba's idmap_ad Backend for Winbind
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The idmap_ad plugin provides a way for Winbind to read id mappings from an AD server that uses RFC2307/SFU schema extensions\. This module implements only the "idmap" API, and is READONLY\. Mappings must be provided in advance by the administrator by adding the posixAccount/posixGroup classess and relative attribute/value pairs to the users and groups objects in AD
.SH "IDMAP OPTIONS"
.PP
range = low \- high
.RS 4
Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the backend is authoritative\. Note that the range acts as a filter\. If specified any UID or GID stored in AD that fall outside the range is ignored and the corresponding map is discarded\. It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps between local and remotely defined IDs\.

.PP
schema_mode = <rfc2307 | sfu >
.RS 4
Defines the schema that idmap_ad should use when querying Active Directory regarding user and group information\. This can either the RFC2307 schema support included in Windows 2003 R2 or the Service for Unix (SFU) schema\.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following example shows how to retrieve idmappings from our principal and and trusted AD domains\. All is needed is to set default to yes\. If trusted domains are present id conflicts must be resolved beforehand, there is no guarantee on the order conflicting mappings would be resolved at this point\. This example also shows how to leave a small non conflicting range for local id allocation that may be used in internal backends like BUILTIN\.

	idmap domains = ALLDOMAINS
	idmap config ALLDOMAINS:backend      = ad
	idmap config ALLDOMAINS:default      = yes
	idmap config ALLDOMAINS:range        = 10000 \- 300000000

	idmap alloc backend = tdb
	idmap alloc config:range        = 5000 \- 9999

The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\.
