.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This VFS module is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\.
.PP
The
vfs_fake_perms
VFS module was created to allow Roaming Profile files and directories to be set (on the Samba server under UNIX) as read only\. This module will, if installed on the Profiles share, report to the client that the Profile files and directories are writeable\. This satisfies the client even though the files will never be overwritten as the client logs out or shuts down\.
.PP
This module is stackable\.
