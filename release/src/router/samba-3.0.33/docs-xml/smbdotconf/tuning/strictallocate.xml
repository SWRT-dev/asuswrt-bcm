    <para>This is a boolean that controls the handling of 
    disk space allocation in the server. When this is set to <constant>yes</constant> 
    the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real
    disk storage blocks when a file is extended to the Windows behaviour
    of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks
    when a file is created or extended to be a given size. In UNIX
    terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.
    This can be slow on some systems.</para>

    <para>When strict allocate is <constant>no</constant> the server does sparse
    disk block allocation when a file is extended.</para>

    <para>Setting this to <constant>yes</constant> can help Samba return
    out of quota messages on systems that are restricting the disk quota
    of users.</para>
