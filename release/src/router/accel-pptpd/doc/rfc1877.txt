Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a family of Network
   Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different
   network-layer protocols.

   This document extends the NCP for establishing and configuring the
   Internet Protocol over PPP [2], defining the negotiation of primary
   and secondary Domain Name System (DNS) [3] and NetBIOS Name Server
   (NBNS) [4] addresses.

1.  Additional IPCP Configuration Options

   The four name server address configuration options, 129 to 132,
   provide a method of obtaining the addresses of Domain Name System
   (DNS) servers and (NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) nodes on the remote
   network.

   Primary and secondary addresses are negotiated independently.  They
   serve identical purposes, except that when both are present an
   attempt SHOULD be made to resolve names using the primary address
   before using the secondary address.

   For implementational convenience, these options are designed to be
   identical in format and behavior to option 3 (IP-Address) which is
   already present in most IPCP implementations.

   Since the usefulness of name server address information is dependent
   on the topology of the remote network and local peer's application,
   it is suggested that these options not be included in the list of
   "IPCP Recommended Options".

1.1.  Primary DNS Server Address

   Description

      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the address of the primary DNS server to be used
      on the local end of the link.  If local peer requests an invalid
      server address (which it will typically do intentionally) the
      remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and
      returning the IP address of a valid DNS server.

      By default, no primary DNS address is provided.

   A summary of the Primary DNS Address Configuration Option format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   Primary-DNS-Address

      The four octet Primary-DNS-Address is the address of the primary
      DNS server to be used by the local peer.  If all four octets are
      set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer
      provide the address information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      No address is provided.

1.2.  Primary NBNS Server Address

   Description

      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the address of the primary NBNS server to be used
      on the local end of the link.  If local peer requests an invalid
      server address (which it will typically do intentionally) the
      remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and
      returning the IP address of a valid NBNS server.

      By default, no primary NBNS address is provided.

   A summary of the Primary NBNS Address Configuration Option format is
   shown below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      NBNS server to be used by the local peer.  If all four octets are
      set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer

      provide the address information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      No address is provided.

1.3.  Secondary DNS Server Address

   Description

      This Configuration Option defines a method for negotiating with
      the remote peer the address of the secondary DNS server to be used
      on the local end of the link.  If local peer requests an invalid
      server address (which it will typically do intentionally) the
      remote peer specifies the address by NAKing this option, and
      returning the IP address of a valid DNS server.

      By default, no secondary DNS address is provided.

   Secondary-DNS-Address

      The four octet Secondary-DNS-Address is the address of the primary
      NBNS server to be used by the local peer.  If all four octets are
      set to zero, it indicates an explicit request that the peer
      provide the address information in a Config-Nak packet.

   Default

      No address is provided.
