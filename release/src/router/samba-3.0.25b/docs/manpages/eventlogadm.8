.PP
This tool is part of the

.SH "EVENTLOG RECORD FORMAT"
.PP
For the write operation,
eventlogadm
expects to be able to read structured records from standard input. These records are a sequence of lines, with the record key and data separated by a colon character. Records are separated by at least one or more blank line.
.PP
The event log record field are:
.TP 3n
\(bu

LEN
- This field should be 0, since
eventlogadm
will calculate this value.
.TP 3n
\(bu

RS1
- This must be the value 1699505740.
.TP 3n
\(bu

RCN
- This field should be 0.
.TP 3n
\(bu

TMG
- The time the eventlog record was generated; format is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970, UTC.
.TP 3n
\(bu

TMW
- The time the eventlog record was written; format is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970, UTC.
.TP 3n
\(bu

EID
- The eventlog ID.
.TP 3n
\(bu

ETP
- The event type -- one of "INFO", "ERROR", "WARNING", "AUDIT SUCCESS" or "AUDIT FAILURE".
.TP 3n
\(bu

ECT
- The event category; this depends on the message file. It is primarily used as a means of filtering in the eventlog viewer.
.TP 3n
\(bu

RS2
- This field should be 0.
.TP 3n
\(bu

CRN
- This field should be 0.
.TP 3n
\(bu

USL
- This field should be 0.
.TP 3n
\(bu

SRC
- This field contains the source name associated with the event log. If a message file is used with an event log, there will be a registry entry for associating this source name with a message file DLL.
.TP 3n
\(bu

SRN
- he name of the machine on which the eventlog was generated. This is typically the host name.
.TP 3n
\(bu

STR
- The text associated with the eventlog. There may be more than one string in a record.
.TP 3n
\(bu

DAT
- This field should be left unset.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
An example of the record format accepted by
eventlogadm:

.nf

	LEN: 0
	RS1: 1699505740
	RCN: 0
	TMG: 1128631322
	TMW: 1128631322
	EID: 1000 
	ETP: INFO
	ECT: 0 
	RS2: 0
	CRN: 0
	USL: 0
	SRC: cron
	SRN: dmlinux
	STR: (root) CMD ( rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.hourly)
	DAT: 
	
.fi
.PP
Set up an eventlog source, specifying a message file DLL:

.nf

	eventlogadm -o addsource Application MyApplication | \\
	    	%SystemRoot%/system32/MyApplication.dll
	
.fi
.PP
Filter messages from the system log into an event log:

.nf

	tail -f /var/log/messages | \\
		my_program_to_parse_into_eventlog_records | \\
	      	eventlogadm SystemLogEvents
	
.fi
