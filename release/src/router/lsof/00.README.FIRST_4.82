A tour of the lsof_4.82 distribution:

  00.README.FIRST_4.82 is this file.

  README.lsof_4.82 contains distribution and security information.

  RELEASE.SUMMARY_4.82 contains a summary of the lsof 4.82
  distribution.

  lsof_4.82_src.tar is the lsof 4.82 source tar archive.

  lsof_4.82_src.tar.sig is a detached GPG certificate for
  lsof_4.82_src.tar.

I suggest you follow these steps:

1.  Read 00.README.FIRST_4.82.

2.  Read README.lsof_4.82 and follow its instructions to verify
    the authenticity of lsof_4.82_src.tar.

3.  Unpack lsof_4.82_src.tar -- use `tar xf lsof_4.82_src.tar`.
    That will produce an lsof_4.82_src sub-directory.

4.  Change to the lsof_4.82_src sub-directory and read its
    00.README.FIRST file.
