* Common Applications Kept Enhanced (CAKE) scheduler

This is the out-of-tree version of [[https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake/][CAKE]], the Linux qdisc that combines scheduler
and traffic shaper for effective bufferbloat mitigation.

Note that sch_cake is part of the upstream Linux kernel since kernel version
4.19, so this repository exists only as a resource for building the qdisc with
older versions of the kernel. If you're already on kernel 4.19 or newer, you can
just load CAKE with =tc= and the kernel shipped by your distribution!
