.SH "NAME"
wsdds \- server to provide WSDD/LLMNR services to clients
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
wsddd2 [\-4] [\-6] [\-L] [\-W] [\-d] [\-h] [\-l] [\-t] [\-u] [\-w]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBwsdd2\fR
is the server daemon that provides WSDD (Web Services Dynamic Discovery)
as well as LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) services
primarily for Windows clients on both IPv4 and IPv6.
.PP
\fBwsdd2\fR's WSDD protocol handler
multicasts Hello and Bye messages by itself over UDP,
submits ProbeMatch and ResolveMatch messages
in response to Probe and Resolve queries respectively over UDP,
and submits HTTP reponse messages
to HTTP property query POST messages over TCP.
.PP
\fBwsdd2\fR's LLMNR protocol handler
responds to LLMNR multicast query messages over UDP
and to LLMNR unicast query messages over TCP.
.PP
\fBwsdd2\fR
uses and listens on the following ports:
.PP
3702 UDP
.RS 4
WSDD multicast group addresses 239.255.255.250 and ff02::c.
.RE
.PP
3702 TCP
.RS 4
WSDD property query over HTTP.
.RE
.PP
5355 UDP
.RS 4
LLMNR query multicast group addresses 224.0.0.252 and ff02::1:3.
.RE
.PP
5355 TCP
.RS 4
LLMNR query unicast.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-4 \-6
.RS 4
Respond only to IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.
Default is equivalent to "\-4 \-6."
.RE
.PP
\-L
.RS 4
Print out LLMNR debug messages to stdout.
Multiple \-L's to increment debug level.
.RE
.PP
\-W
.RS 4
Print out WSDD debug messages to stdout.
Multiple \-W's to increment debug level.
.RE
.PP
\-b "\fIkey1\fR:\fIval1\fR,\fIkey2\fR:\fIval2\fR,\fI...\fR"
.RS 4
Set WSDD query over HTTP response values in a comma-delimited list.
The valid/necessary keys are:
.RS 4
vendor
model
serial
sku
vendorurl
modelutl
presentationurl
.RE
This option overrides /proc/sys/dev/boot/info readouts.
.RE
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Fork off a child process to go daemon.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Display a simple help messasge to stdout.
.RE
.PP
\-l \-w
.RS 4
Respond only to LLMNR and WSDD respectively.
Default is equivalent to "\-l \-w."
.RE
.PP
\-t \-u
.RS 4
Respond only to TCP and UDP respectively.
Default is equivalent to "\-t \-u."
.RE
.RE
.SH "WSDD PROPERTY QUERY RESPONSE"
.PP
\fBwsdd2\fR
responds to property queries using the following values over HTTP.
If a value may be set with multiple methods,
the latter in the method list has precedence.
.PP
Vendor
.RS 4
Value retrieved from /proc/sys/dev/boot/info or set with the -b option.
.RE
.PP
VendorURL
.RS 4
Value set with the -b option.
.RE
.PP
Model
.RS 4
Value retrieved from /proc/sys/dev/boot/info or set with the -b option.
.RE
.PP
ModelURL
.RS 4
Value set with the -b option.
.RE
.PP
PresentationURL
.RS 4
Value set with the -b option.
.RE
.PP
Host
.RS 4
Host name retrieved with \fBgethostname\fR(3),
NETBIOS name retrieved with \fBtestparm\fR(1),
or value set with the -b option.
.RE
.PP
Workgroup
.RS 4
Value retrieved with \fBtestparm\fR(1) or set with the -b option.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
/etc/samba/smb.conf
.RS 4
This is the default location of the samba configuration file.
.RE
.PP
/etc/machine-id
.RS 4
A single line text file containing a host-unique UUID in the form of
xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.
To create a such new file, use \fBuuidgen\fR(1).
.RE
.PP
/proc/sys/dev/boot/info
.RS 4
A list of \fIkey\fR:\fIvalue\fR entries for 
WSDD query over HTTP response values.
.RE
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
Sending the
\fBwsdd2\fR
a SIGHUP will cause it to restart.
Restarting will re-parse
\fBtestparm\fR(1)'s output and other parameters,
but it will not re-evaluated command line options.
Any change on, addition of, or deletion of a network interface
will restart
\fBwsdd2\fR
as well.
.PP
SIGTERM and SIGINT will terminate
\fBwsdd2\fR
gracefully with WSDD Bye messages.

The WSDD protocol is described in detail in
"Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery)
Version 1.1" OASYS Standard 1 July 2009
.br
http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/discovery/1.1/os/wsdd-discovery-1.1-spec-os.html
.PP
LLMNR complies with RFC4795.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
Hiro Sugawara at NETGEAR authored the code.
\fBwsdd2\fR was inspired by and uses some code from
the wsdd/llmnr extension for smbd
created by
Tobias Waldvogel,
