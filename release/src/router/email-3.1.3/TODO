TODO Sheet...
List things to do for the project here.

* Have mimetypes come from file extensions instead of using the 'file' 
  command and mime magic. Other clients do this and it keeps it simple.
* Work on line wrapping at 72 chars.  Possible solution is going to be loading
  the entire text portion of the email into memory and plucking each character
  out of memory.  ONLY Possible solution here...
* Make some sample scripts and add them to the release of email so that people
  can see how to use email in bash scripts.
* Fix up our hash functions.  
* Remove redundant displayed errors.

-- FUTURE WORK --
* Look into S/MIME Support
* Implement OpenSSL
* Reorganize Code
* Josh Sherman suggested that scripts should be able to run as signature files.
